  abstract = {Zapotec languages are known for their complex tonal and phonation systems. Fieldwork in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ), an undocumented language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico, suggests the implementation of six tones (high, mid, low, high-falling, mid-falling and rising) and four phonation types (modal, creaky, checked and breathy). We report on the reliability of acoustic measures such as (H1-H2) and (H1-A1), which have previously been reported to characterize phonation types. Spectral measurements including H1, H2 (first and second harmonics), A1 (amplitude of F1) and A2 (amplitude of F2) are taken from vowels in near minimal pairs controlled for tones and quality. We also report on the relative implementation of tone and phonation. Silverman (1997) argues that languages with contrastive tone and phonation optimize the realization of laryngeal events such that non-modal vowels have a modal portion where the tonal event is implemented. We discuss if Silverman’s predictions are borne out in SLZ.},

  abstract = {This study looks at the relative importance of phonation type in identifying tones in languages with a ‘mixed’ pitch/phonation tone system. Green Mong is a tone language with an inventory of 7 contrastive tones and a tonal system that incorporates both fundamental frequency (FO) and phonation type distinctions. The study examines 3 Green Mong tones, which have similar FO contours and are characterized by the distinctive use of breathy, creaky and modal phonation. Acoustic analyses of 3 male and 3 female speakers' productions indicate that the tones are distinguished by their FO, relative amplitude of lower and higher harmonics (H1-H2), vowel duration, vowel quality and voice onset times. Discriminant analyses, used to estimate the relative value of these different cues, indicate that H1-H2 is the best predictor of tone category membership. This is the case for both high and low vowels, although the magnitude of the H1-H2 difference is substantially smaller for high vowels. The 2 predictor variables which are next most strongly correlated with the discriminant functions also relate to phonation type. However, FO does continue to play a role in classification of tokens into tone categories.},

This study examines perceptual and acoustic data to address the question of what makes tones clear when tonal identity is determined by this complex of acoustic cues. Native listeners were asked to categorize three tones which have similar falling contours, but which are differentiated by phonation type. Tokens that were correctly identified by 100\% of the listeners were compared with tokens that were poorly identified. Perceptually, the breathy and creaky tones are less susceptible to identification errors than the modal tone. Acoustically, the clearest tokens of the three tones are differentiated by details of pitch contour shape, as well as by phonation-type cues. Clear tokens of the creaky and breathy tones are characterized by extreme acoustic cue values which shift these tokens away from space that is occupied by other tones. In contrast, the modal tone essentially occupies the middle ground for the cues examined here: more extreme acoustic values shift the modal tone into acoustic space that is occupied by some other tone in the language.},

  abstract = {Focus marking is an important function of prosody in many languages. While many phonological accounts concentrate on fundamental frequency (F\textsubscript{0}), studies have established several additional cues to information structure. However, the relationship between these cues is rarely investigated. We simultaneously analyzed five prosodic cues to focus—F\textsubscript{0 }range, word duration, intensity, voice quality, the location of the F\textsubscript{0 }maximum, and the occurrence of pauses—in a set of 947 simple Subject Verb Object (SVO) sentences uttered by 17 native speakers of Finnish. Using random forest and generalized additive mixed modelling, we investigated the systematicity of prosodic focus marking, the importance of each cue as a predictor, and their functional shape. Results indicated a highly consistent differentiation between narrow focus and givenness, marked by at least F\textsubscript{0 }range, word duration, intensity, and the location of the F\textsubscript{0 }maximum, with F\textsubscript{0 }range being the most important predictor. No cue had a linear relationship with focus condition. To account for the simultaneous significance of several predictors, we argue that these findings support treating multiple prosodic cues to focus in Finnish as correlates of prosodic phrasing. Thus, we suggest that prosodic phrasing, having multiple functions, is also marked with multiple cues to enhance communicative efficiency.},

  abstract = {Languages where phonation type and tone are contrastive make use of extremely fine and controlled actions of laryngeal structures; hence, there is little opportunity to variation in either phonation or pitch. Nonetheless, many American Indian languages have contrastive nonmodal phonation, which, moreover, is subject to a great deal of variation. There are a few studies addressing the phonetics of nonmodal phonation in American Indian languages, and little is known about the phonetics/phonology interface of laryngeal features within the sound patterns of these languages. This article aims to contribute to the knowledge of nonmodal phonation through the detailed study of the phenomenon in Yalálag Zapotec (YZ) and American Indian language. A series of spectral and electrophysiological analyses contribute to the description of YZ nonmodal phonation and its variability across gender. It is argued that the temporal patterns in realization of laryngealization are a property of YZ speaker's grammar.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is primarily intended as a description of the Yalálag Zapotec (YZ) language of Oaxaca, México, with particular reference to its phonetic structures. The first section is an introduction to the Yalálag Zapotec language, its orthography and basic facts of its grammar. Chapter 2 outlines the noun and verb morphology, and Chapter 3 presents a sketch of sentence structure. The second section provides a detailed description of the phonetic structures of the language. Chapter 4 deals with vowels, consonants and tone. The YZ five modal vowels and four laryngealized vowels are described here. The phonetic properties of consonants are also presented, including the phonetic correlates of the fortis-lenis contrast. It is shown that VOT is a reliable parameter for obstruents; the phonetics of obstruent devoicing and consonant clusters are discussed. A description of the three contrastive tones in YZ closes the chapter. YZ data supports the typology of contour tone restrictions based on the weight of the rime: more sonorous and longer rimes are capable of bearing Falling tone; however, Falling tone can occur in non-sonorous rimes. Chapter 5 offers an analysis of vowel phonation, describing in detail the acoustic properties of modal and laryngealized vowels. The analysis shows that the time course of phonation in YZ is restricted to the edges of the vowel. This pattern suggests that the timing of nonmodal phonation is organized to guarantee the production and perception of multiple phonemic features that could otherwise contradict each other in actual implementation. Chapter 6 presents a palatographic and acoustic study of YZ coronals, denti-alveolars, postalveolars and alveo-palatals. The compression of coronal consonants in a narrow articulatory space allows us to observe the degree of variability in their production. The third section is composed of two chapters devoted to an investigation of the perception of tone in YZ. Chapter 7 investigates whether the perception of tone in YZ is categorical. Chapter 8 presents a dichotic listening experiment concerning the perception of linguistic and non-linguistic pitch in YZ. The results do not support a categorical perception of tone and show a consistent right ear advantage for lexical tone.},

  abstract = {This paper updates the reconstruction of the stative aspect prefix in Proto-Zapotecan as *n- and tracks innovations in stative marking. An early change is proposed to have deleted preconsonantal nasals, rendering segmentally unmarked stative forms of consonant-initial verbs in varieties of Zapotec then spoken in and around the city of Monte Albán. Contact with Chatino may be a factor in the retention of preconsonantal *n in Zapotec varieties spoken to the south. A fuller stative prefix, usually *na-, arose later from a grammaticalized form of the stative-marked copula (Munro 2007; Uchihara 2021). *na- is more productive than *n- and provides the basis for a new proposed “Eastern Zapotec” genetic grouping. However, the isogloss for *na- crosscuts the earlier isogloss for preconsonantal nasal deletion, showing that any model of Zapotecan linguistic history needs to address not only divergence but also convergence. Ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence provide a social context to the linguistic changes discussed.},

If the errors indeed show autocorrelational structure, evaluation of the significance of predictors in the model becomes problematic due to potential anti-conservatism of p-values. This paper illustrates two tools offered by Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) (Lin and Zhang, 1999; Wood, 2006, 2011, 2013) for dealing with autocorrelated errors, as implemented in the current version of the fourth author's mgcv package (1.8.9): the possibility to specify an ar(1) error model for Gaussian models, and the possibility of using factor smooths for random-effect factors such as subject and item. These factor smooths are set up to have the same smoothing parameters, and are penalized to yield the non-linear equivalent of random intercepts and random slopes in the classical linear framework. Three case studies illustrate these issues.},

Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy - though this may be changing - and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

  abstract = {This paper presents novel data from San Pablo Macuiltianguis Zapotec, a Sierra Juárez~variety spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico. This language is ‘laryngeally complex’ (Silverman,~1997), exhibiting both contrastive tone and contrastive phonation. We examine the~acoustic properties of the modal and checked vowels in this language, showing that~this contrast is variably produced with several different acoustic cues. We analyze the~distribution of these cues as an instance of phonetic enhancement and further show~that the prosodic position of a given vowel determines which of several enhancement~patterns is used. We argue that extant theories of phonetic enhancement, while able to explain the patterns described here, fall short of predicting the distribution of~enhancing cues. We therefore propose that future models of phonetic enhancement~could be expanded to predict patterns in which more than one acoustic dimension is~available for phonetic enhancement.},

  abstract = {Uspanteko is an endangered Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. Unstressed vowels in Uspanteko often delete, though deletion is variable within and across speakers. Deletion appears to be phonological: it is sensitive to foot structure, morphology, and certain phonotactics, and it occurs in slow, careful speech. But deletion also has characteristics more typical of a phonetic process: it is intertwined with a pattern of gradient vowel reduction and is insensitive to most phonotactics. Electroglottography data shows that even 'deleted' vowels may contribute voicing to  intervals when flanked by voiceless consonants. This suggests that 'deleted' vowels are represented in the input to speech production, even when they are acoustically masked by articulatory overlap with adjacent segments. We conclude that vowel deletion is grammatically controlled gestural overlap, consistent with the claim that phonological representations encode information about the relative timing and coordination of articulatory gestures (e.g. Browman \& Goldstein 1986, Gafos 2002). At a minimum, language-specific phonetic processes must have access to more fine-grained, abstract grammatical information than is usually assumed.*},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I investigate the phonology, phonetics, and historical development of Santa María Gueinagati Zapotec (GZ), an Otomanguean language spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico. My description of the phonology of GZ focuses of the contrasts the occur in the root, which, in its final position, hosts all of the phonological contrasts found in the language. My findings are that GZ has a tonal inventory of low, mid, and high, and each tone can occur on both glottalized and non-glottalized vowels. Root-initial consonants have a contrast between a voiced and a voiceless series, while root final consonants show two major contrasts: 1) a long vs. short contrast, which corresponds with the lenis-fortis contrast of other Zapotec languages, and 2) a separate voiced vs. voiceless (or alternatively, nonaspirated vs. preaspirated) contrast that is unique to GZ. The phonetic study component of this dissertation examines the so-called ’lenis-fortis’ contrast that is described for all Zapotec languages. Because GZ has the unique charac- teristic of a voicing contrast in post-tonic consonants that is independent of the lenis-fortis contrast, I investigate the role of the duration ratio of the post-tonic consonant to the tonic vowel (C-V) ratio. I find that the C-V ratio is a reliable parameter along which to base the lenis-fortis contrast. In addition, phonetic differences in C-V ratio can serve as a secondary cue to other contrasts, such as the voicing contrast of the post-tonic consonant, as well as the glottalization contrast of the tonic vowel. Finally, I examine how GZ’s unique inventory of contrasts evolved from its parent parent language based on a comparative study with the closest related languages,spoken in Guevea de Humboldt and Santo Domingo Petapa. In this study, I conclude that the tones of these laryngeally complex languages (Silverman, 1997) undergo some of the same types of historical processes as regular tone languages, such as peak delay and carryover effects. In addition, I find that other laryngeal targets, namely glottalization and aspiration, are also subject to a similar type of delay, or rightward sliding. This is in line with the proposal of Hyman and Schuh (1974) that the laryngeal articulators adjust at a slower pace than the supralaryngeal articulators, thus causing a mismatch in alignment of the oral and laryngeal gestures.},

This paper considers phonetic variability in laryngealized resonants, which are rare cross-linguistically but common in the Pacific Northwest languages (Salish and Wakashan). Previous literature on these sounds has focused primarily on variability in timing between the oral and laryngeal gestures. This paper explores instead variability in the realization of the laryngeal gesture, focusing on St’át’imcets (Lillooet Salish). Pitch, amplitude, and duration measurements are taken to characterize the laryngeal gesture of intervocalic laryngealized resonants. Results exhibit a high degree of variability but show that, overall, realization depends primarily on the location of the laryngealized resonant with respect to word stress: the correlates of laryngealization are acoustically stronger in post-stress than in pre-stress position. Results are discussed in terms of their possible causes and in terms of their implications for how sound structure is lexically encoded.},

  abstract = {Background:Modern Match-theoretic approaches to prosodic structure derive cross-linguisticvariation in prosody from two sources: (i) variation in syntactic structure and (ii) variation in theranking of a set of universal markedness constraints on syntax-prosody mappings. In this study,we hold (i) constant in order to examine (ii) more closely. We show with novel fieldwork datathat Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ) fills a problematic gap in the prosody of VSO languages.VSO languages differ in the prosodic phrasing of transitive sentences with full DP arguments(1). In Irish (Celtic: Elfner 2012; Bennett, Elfner, \& McCloskey 2016), (1a) is observed for complexsubjects and (1b) possible for single-word subjects. Otomi (Oto-Manguean: Palancar 2004) shows(1b), and Ch’ol (Mayan: Clemens \& Coon 2018, Clemens 2019) shows (1c).(1)a. V [SO]    b. [VS] O    c. [V] [S] [O]A language with only (1a) would be generated if Match outranks certain markedness constraints.According to Kalivoda (2018), no such language has been attested: a challenge to Match theory.We show here that SLZ fills this gap.Language \& Methodology:SLZ is an endangered Oto-Manguean (Northern Zapotec) languagespoken in Santiago Laxopa, Ixtlán, Oaxaca, Mexico. It features VSO structure and lexical tone.Data presented here comes from weekly virtual elicitation with one native speaker consultantduring the COVID-19 pandemic.Phenomenon:In languages with downstep, particular tone values trigger lowering for subse-quent tones within a prosodic domain (Connell 2011). Patterns of downstep can thus be used asa diagnostic for prosodic structure (e.g. Xitsonga: Selkirk 2009, 2011). We observe in SLZ that aH-tone causes downstep of all subsequent H-tones only within certain domains, which we taketo be non-maximal phonological phrases (φnonmax) (Ito \& Mester 2012). The right edge of theseφnonmaxare associated with pitch resets.Prosodic structure:Using downstep as our diagnostic for the placement of φnonmax, we proposethat transitive sentences in SLZ with full DPs are phrased as in (2a)—e.g.Bgò békù’nh↓békù’nh,‘The dog fed the dog.’ An alternative phrasing (2b) is only possible with dependent pronominalsubjects—e.g.Bkàtch=é’ békù’nh, ‘She (an elder) hid the dog.’(2)a.[ι[φmaxVω[φSω↓Oω]φ]φmax]ιb.[ι[φmax(VωScl)ω[φOω]φ]φmax]ιH-tones in a subject trigger downstep in an object, regardless of the amount of phonological ma-terial intervening, suggesting the arguments are phrased together. A lack of downstep betweenH-tones in the verb and the subject shows the verb lies outside this φ. Weak subjects (clitics),however, must adjoin to the verb (2b): subject clitics with H-tone fail to trigger downstep in ob-jects. Finally, crucial evidence for recursion comes from the fact that downstep is not observedfor H-tones within the verb; we conclude the verb adjoins without its own φ.Analysis:As noted by Clemens \& Coon (2018), existing syntactic accounts of VSO structure arenot distinct for purposes of syntax-prosody mapping, all yielding the simplified schema in (3).(3)[CP[TPV[XPSDPODP]XP]TP]CPTo capture the typology of VSO prosodies, we assume the existence of the constraints Match(XP,φ),StRongStaRt(XP), EalSisteRs, and BinaRity, as defined in Bennett et al. (2016). SLZ phras-ing is predicted when Match dominates ES and Bin, with the behavior of clitic subjects derivedfrom undominated StRongStaRt. Other rankings of these four constraints produce the attestedpatterns of Irish, Otomi, and Ch’ol. SLZ thus validates the typology predicted by Match theory,defending its validity as a theory of the syntax-prosody interface},

  abstract = {We have argued that dynamically defined articulatory gestures are the appropriate units to serve as the atoms of phonological representation. Gestures are a natural unit, not only because they involve task-oriented movements of the articulators, but because they arguably emerge as prelinguistic discrete units of action in infants. The use of gestures, rather than constellations of gestures as in Root nodes, as basic units of description makes it possible to characterise a variety of language patterns in which gestural organisation varies. Such patterns range from the misorderings of disordered speech through phonological rules involving gestural overlap and deletion to historical changes in which the overlap of gestures provides a crucial explanatory element.Gestures can participate in language patterns involving overlap because they are spatiotemporal in nature and therefore have internal duration. In addition, gestures differ from current theories of feature geometry by including the constriction degree as an inherent part of the gesture. Since the gestural constrictions occur in the vocal tract, which can be charactensed in terms of tube geometry, all the levels of the vocal tract will be constricted, leading to a constriction degree hierarchy. The values of the constriction degree at each higher level node in the hierarchy can be predicted on the basis of the percolation principles and tube geometry. In this way, the use of gestures as atoms can be reconciled with the use of Constriction degree at various levels in the vocal tract (or feature geometry) hierarchy.The phonological notation developed for the gestural approach might usefully be incorporated, in whole or in part, into other phonologies. Five components of the notation were discussed, all derived from the basic premise that gestures are the primitive phonological unit, organised into gestural scores. These components include (1) constriction degree as a subordinate of the articulator node and (2) stiffness (duration) as a subordinate of the articulator node. That is, both CD and duration are inherent to the gesture. The gestures are arranged in gestural scores using (3) articulatory tiers, with (4) the relevant geometry (articulatory, tube or feature) indicated to the left of the score and (5) structural information above the score, if desired. Association lines can also be used to indicate how the gestures are combined into phonological units. Thus, gestures can serve both as characterisations of articulatory movement data and as the atoms of phonological representation.},

In articulatory phonology, the basic units of phonological contrast are               gestures               , which are also abstract characterizations of articulatory events, each with an intrinsic time or duration. Utterances are modeled as organized patterns (               constellations               ) of gestures, in which gestural units may overlap in time. The phonological structures defined in this way provide a set of articulatorily based natural classes. Moreover, the patterns of overlapping organization can be used to specify important aspects of the phonological structure of particular languages, and to account, in a coherent and general way, for a variety of different types of phonological variation. Such variation includes allophonic variation and fluent speech alternations, as well as ‘coarticulation’ and speech errors. Finally, it is suggested that the gestural approach clarifies our understanding of phonological development, by positing that prelinguistic units of action are harnessed into (gestural) phonological structures through differentiation and coordination.},

Articulatory evidence from American English words with a variety of initial consonants and clusters shows that syllable-initial consonants form a global organization (indexed by a metric we term the C-center) that is coordinated with the syllable’s vowel gesture. For syllable-final consonants, however, the evidence suggests that a local organization is employed: The first postvocalic consonant gesture is coordinated with the vowel gesture. Implications of these different styles of organization for the perceptual and phonological structure of speech are discussed.},

It lacks "bird," "wug" (e.g., American English bug), and "mammal." "Wug" and "mammal," however, exist in "emerging" or "incipient" forms in the language. Creatures are included in these categories only if they are not recognized as belonging to some other life-form or generic class. In other words, all known animals are excluded. Evidence from several other languages for incipient biological life forms is presented. It is proposed that development of incipient life-form classes has often been precursory to the emergence of full-fledged biological life-form classes in languages in general.},

Results show that the f0 contours of Northern Vietnamese tones are not only attributable to changes in vocal fold length and tension (partly through changes in larynx height), but that f0 drops are also largely caused by the glottal configurations responsible for the contrastive voice qualities associated with some of the tones. We also find that voice quality contrasts are mostly due to glottal constriction: they occasionally involve additional ventricular fold incursion and epiglottal constriction, but these articulations are usually absent.},

  abstract = {The Chamic language family is often cited as a test case for contact linguistics. Although Chamic languages are Austronesian, they are claimed to have converged with Mon-Khmer languages and adopted features from their closest neighbors. A good example of such a convergence is the realization of phonological register in Cham dialects. In many Southeast Asian languages, the loss of the voicing contrast in onsets has led to the development of two registers, bundles of features that initially included pitch, voice quality, vowel quality and durational differences and that are typically realized on rimes. While Cambodian Cham realizes register mainly through vowel quality, just like Khmer, the registers of the Cham dialect spoken in south-central Vietnam (Eastern Cham) are claimed to have evolved into tone, a property that plays a central role in Vietnamese phonology. This dissertation evaluates the hypothesis that contact with Vietnamese is responsible for the recent evolution of Eastern Cham register by exploring the nature of the sound system of Eastern Cham from phonetic, phonological and sociolinguistic perspectives. Proponents of the view that Eastern Cham has a complex tone system claim that tones arose from the phonemicization of register allophones conditioned by codas after the weakening or deletion of coda stops and laryngeals. Based on phonetic and phonological evidence, I reject this claim. I also provide phonological evidence against the weaker claim that the two registers are evolving into two tones. I show that Eastern Cham register is realized through two redundant phonological features: a register feature, realized on onsets, and a tone feature, realized on rimes. Sociolinguistic results show that there is no robust correlation between the familiarity or the frequency of use of Vietnamese by individual speakers and the use of pitch or the maximization of the pitch range to distinguish registers. The centrality of pitch in the register distinction thus cannot be attributed to language contact in a straightforward way and a simplistic view of contact-induced change must be rejected. I show through a study of variability in the use of monosyllables that it is not direct contact with Vietnamese, but rather the destabilizing effect of Vietnamese culture and society on the balance between the various language varieties used in the community, that triggers language change.},

Each of these perceptual cues is used for more than one tone, which suggests that listeners establish economical patterns of perceptual contrast. Although the two dialects under study share common identification cues, they also exhibit differences, especially with respect to the use of voice quality, which is an important cue in Northern Vietnamese but only plays a limited role in Southern Vietnamese. Results further suggest that Southern Vietnamese listeners can adjust their perception strategies to northern cues, which is expected since Northern Vietnamese is the standard national variety. Interestingly, the phonetic properties of tones (perceptual or acoustic) do not match the phonologically active tone classes of Vietnamese. Based on these results, previous models of Vietnamese tone features are challenged and a model of abstract tonal categories associated with a flexible phonetic knowledge is argued for.},

  abstract = {Southeast Asia is often considered a quintessential Sprachbund where languages from five different language phyla have been converging typologically for millennia. One of the common features shared by many languages of the area is tone: several major national languages of the region have large tone inventories and complex tone contours. In this paper, we suggest a more fine-grained view. We show that in addition to a large number of atonal languages, the tone languages of the region are actually far more diverse than usually assumed, and employ phonation type contrasts at least as often as pitch. Along the same lines, we argue that concepts such as tone and register, while descriptively useful, can obscure important underlying similarities and impede our understanding of the behavior of phonetic properties, typological regularities, and diachrony. We finally draw the reader’s attention to some issues of current interest in the study of tone and phonation in Southeast Asia and describe some technical developments that are likely to allow researchers to address new lines of research in years to come.},

Three main observations motivate the study: 1. Strong documentation and a relatively large and active speaker community create a unique opportunity to document information structure in Isthmus Zapotec and to study the language as it is used by speakers in everyday life; 2. As a tonal and verb-initial language, the examination of Isthmus Zapotec represents a chance to explore the possible combinations of tone, intonation, morphology and verb-initial syntax that may occur in the coding of information structure; and 3. The close analysis of spontaneous speech in an endangered language contributes to our theoretical understanding of information structure and informs our knowledge of language documentation practices and revitalization efforts. Overall, the analysis presented here demonstrates the value and need for information structure studies to document and analyze naturally-occurring data.},

  abstract = {The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

  abstract = {Choguita Rarámuri is a Uto-Aztecan language from Northern Mexico featuring both stress and tone in its word prosody, as well as postlexical intonation. Based on the analysis of instrumental data obtained through field research, this chapter describes how lexical tones in this language are realized in terms of fundamental frequency (f0); how tonal realization varies by phrasal position in declarative sentences; and also how correlates of voice quality help increase the acoustic differentiation across tones for some speakers. In addition, the chapter describes how tone and intonation interact and shows that the incorporation of f0 over pre- and post-tonic syllables generally improves the statistical discriminability of the three tones in utterance-medial position. Therefore, tonal contrasts in this language are as much about paradigmatic differences across the tone categories during the tone-bearing syllable, as they are about syntagmatic changes over at least three syllables centered around the tone-bearing syllable.},

  abstract = {A “checked” syllable usually refers to one with a short vowel and an oral or glottal coda, which results impressionistically in a “short” and “abrupt” quality. Although common in languages of the world, it is unclear how to characterize checked syllables phonetically. In this study, we investigated the acoustic features of checked syllables in citation and sandhi forms in Xiapu Min, an under-documented language from China. We conducted a production experiment and analyzed the F0, phonatory quality, vowel duration, and vowel quality in checked syllables. The results show that, in citation tones, checked syllables are realized with distinct F0 contours from unchecked syllables, along with glottalization in the end and a shorter duration overall. In sandhi tones, checked syllables lose their distinct F0 contours and become less glottalized. However, the shorter duration of checked syllables is retained in sandhi forms. This study lays out the acoustic properties that tend to be associated with checked syllables and can be used when testing checked syllables in other language varieties. The fact that in Xiapu Min sandhi checked tones become less glottalized but preserve their shorter duration suggests that, when checked syllables become unchecked diachronically, glottalization might be lost prior to duration lengthening.},

  abstract = {The measure H1–H2, the difference in amplitude between the first and second harmonics, is frequently used to distinguish phonation types and to characterize differences across voices and genders. While H1–H2 can differentiate voices and is used by listeners to perceive changes in voice quality, its relation to voice articulation is less straightforward. Its calculation also involves practical issues with error propagation. This paper highlights some developments in the use of H1–H2 and proposes a new measure that we call “residual H1.” In residual H1, the amplitude of the first harmonic is normalized against the overall sound energy (as measured by root mean square energy) instead of against H2. Residual H1 may mitigate some of the issues with using H1–H2. The current study tests the correlation between residual H1 and electroglottographic contact quotient (CQ) and compares the ability of residual H1 vs H1–H2 to differentiate statistically across phonation types in !Xóõ and utterance-level changes in phonatory quality in Mandarin. The results show that residual H1 has a stronger correlation with CQ and differentiates contrastive and allophonic phonatory quality better than H1–H2, particularly for more constricted phonation types.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the interaction between different prosodic patterns in Quiaviní Zapotec (Otomanguean), and accounts for them both at the phonetic and the phonological level. In it, I examine an array of complex patterns along multiple dimensions, including metrical structure, tone, and phonation types; as well as how these patterns interact with the fortis/lenis distinction, and syllable structure. Within the framework of Optimality Theory, my analysis sheds light on the phonetics-phonology interface and emphasizes the need for a theory with moraic structure. 	This dissertation presents the first thorough phonetic documentation of the prosody of Quiaviní Zapotec. It makes a significant empirical contribution by providing descriptive generalizations of vowel and consonant length, a reanalysis of tone as contrastive in Quiaviní Zapotec, and a new approach to the study of the four-way phonation contrast in this language — modal /a/, breathy /a̤/, creaky /a̰/ and interrupted /aʔ/ vowels — (cf. Munro \& Lopez, 1999).  	In addition, this research makes significant contributions to phonological theory, with regards to both segmental and prosodic phenomena. Within an emergent feature approach, I revisit the fortis/lenis distinction, which crosscuts the obstruent-sonorant contrast in Quiaviní Zapotec. I analyze it as a composite of language-specific phonological and phonetic properties, encoded with the feature [+/-fortis]. Adding to the typology of syllable weight, fortis consonants are analyzed as moraic in coda position, but among them, only fortis sonorants may bear tone alongside vowels (i.e.  *[-SON][TONE] ‘No tones on obstruents’). 	Furthermore, I show specific timing patterns for the phonetic implementation of tonal and laryngeal features. Quiaviní Zapotec exhibits compatibility of contrasts; compromise of phonological features (e.g. tonal contrasts are cued during modal phonation, followed by breathiness or laryngealization); or complete incompatibility, which translates into phonemic gaps. This distribution is formalized in terms of markedness interaction and grounded constraints (e.g. ‘If [+spread glottis], then Low tone’, accounting for the absence of high tone with breathy vowels). 	Overall, the thesis analyzes the minimal prosodic word in Quiaviní Zapotec (a bimoraic foot) as the domain where the full array of tonal and phonation type contrasts takes place, and illustrates particular mechanisms by which phonetic factors shape phonology.},

  abstract = {Georgian, a South Caucasian language belonging to the Kartvelian  family,  is characterised by the ability of its consonants to combine in extensive  clusters. Among the possible combinations are a series of two-member  clusters which are argued to behave phonologically as single segments  (Tschenkeli 1958, Vogt 1958, 1971, Aronson 1982, 1991, Deprez 1988 and  others). They are known as ‘harmonic’ clusters, because the  laryngeal  quality is constant across the cluster. Its two members are both voiced  ([dg bg dγ bγ]), both aspirated  ([thkh tshkh  thχ tshχ]) or both ejective  ([t'k' ts'k' p'k' t'q' ts'q']).  They can occur either word-initially or in word-medial  position. Harmonic clusters do not contrast with identical sequences of  segments, except for sequences formed at the junction of two words.  There is no evidence that across word boundaries harmonic clusters are  derived by some sort of restructuring.The purpose of the present study is to review the phonological  arguments brought in the literature in favour of treating harmonic clusters  as single segments, and to look for acoustic evidence that would motivate  the distinction made between harmonic clusters behaving as single  segments, on the one hand, and simple sequences of consonants, on the  other hand. The study uses phonetic data to address the issue of  phonological representation. If the difference between a harmonic cluster  and a simple sequence of segments is present in the phonology, then it  should ideally also be visible in the acoustic signal, for example in the  presence or absence of a release burst, or in timing differences, as  suggested by previous studies of complex vs. simple segments in  various  languages (Maddieson \& Ladefoged 1989, Maddieson 1989, 1990). The  results show that the treatment of Georgian harmonic clusters as complex  segments is not supported by the acoustic data.The paper is organised as follows: § 2 presents the phonological  behaviour of consonant clusters in Georgian, § 3 reviews phonetic  evidence  for complex segments, and spells out the predictions made by the present  study. The acoustic study is described in § 4, followed by the presentation  and discussion of results in § 5. The conclusions and areas for further  study are presented in § 6.},

The collection provides extensive data obtained from 270 speakers across those languages, examining VOT and other acoustic, aerodynamic and articulatory measures. The languages studied may be divided into four groups: ‘aspirating’ languages with a two-way contrast (English, three varieties of German); ‘true voicing’ languages with a two-way contrast (Russian, Turkish, Brazilian Portuguese, two Iranian languages Pashto and Wakhi); languages with a three-way contrast (Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Yerevan Armenia, three Indo-Aryan languages, Dawoodi, Punjabi and Shina, and Burushaki); and Indo-Aryan languages with a more than three-way contrast (Jangli and Urdu with a four-way contrast, and Sindhi and Siraiki with a five-way contrast). We discuss the cross-linguistic data, focusing on how much VOT alone tells us about the voicing contrast in these languages, and what other phonetic dimensions (such as consonant-induced F0 and voice quality) are needed for a complete understanding of laryngeal contrast in these languages. Implications for various issues emerge: universal phonetic feature systems, effects of language contact on linguistic levelling, and the relation between laryngeal contrast and supralaryngeal articulation. The cross-linguistic VOT data also lead us to discuss how the distribution of VOT as measured acoustically may allow us to infer the underlying articulation and how it might be approached in gestural phonologies. The discussion on these multiple issues sparks new questions to be resolved, and provide indications of where the field may be best directed in exploring laryngeal contrast in voicing in the world’s languages.},

  abstract = {Most theories of phonetics assume a tight relation between production and perception, and recent years have also seen increasing evidence for such a relation at the level of the individual. For the most part, however, this evidence comes from socially homogeneous speech communities where the targeted pattern of variation is mostly socially neutral. What implications might socially structured phonetic variation in the speech community have for the perception-production link? If listeners can predict the phonetic patterns of a talker based on the talker’s actual or assumed identity, would they adjust their perceptual strategies accordingly, possibly weakening the link between their own production and perception patterns? This study reports the results of a pair of experiments that investigate the production and perception of coarticulatory vowel nasalization in Afrikaans, a language for which variation in coarticulatory nasalization is socially structured. Relying on nasal airflow measures, the production experiment showed that speakers of White Afrikaans produce more extensive coarticulatory nasalization than speakers of Kleurling Afrikaans. The perception experiment used an eye-tracking paradigm to assess listeners’ perceptual reliance on coarticulatory nasalization, and found (i) that Afrikaans speakers’ use of coarticulatory nasalization in production predicts their perceptual reliance on this information, (ii) that they rapidly adjust to the coarticulatory timing patterns in the speech of other speakers, but also (iii) that they do not adjust their perceptual reliance on coarticulation in response to the assumed identity of the speaker. The link between perception and production therefore persists, even in this situation of socially structured variation in coarticulatory timing.},

Then we evaluate the extent to which sonority projection is predicted by existing computational models of phonotactics (Coleman \& Pierrehumbert 1997, Hayes \& Wilson 2008, inter alia). We show that a model based only on lexical statistics can explain sonority projection in English without a pre-existing sonority sequencing principle. To do this, a model must possess (i) a featural system supporting sonority-based generalisations, and (ii) a context representation including syllabification or equivalent information.},

A primary acoustic and perceptual cue to creaky voice quality is a low fundamental frequency. Previous research has shown that listeners can make fine-grained comparisons of speakers' habitual modal pitch, but this study focuses on how a combination of modal and nonmodal phonation affects the perception of habitual pitch. A perception experiment assesses whether listeners are more likely to rate a speaker's utterance as being holistically lower in pitch if it contains both modal and creaky voice than if it is fully modal speech. Results indicate that for female American English speakers with higher modal pitch, the inclusion of creaky voice leads listeners to rate such utterances as lower in pitch than fully modal utterances, but not for speakers with lower modal pitch. These results are consistent with studies showing that pitch perception interacts with nonmodal phonation, and they relate to previous observations that speakers may utilize nonmodal phonation to manipulate their intended habitual pitch.*},

Methods: In this study, American listeners are presented with 2 experiments containing stimuli from both high- and low-pitched male and female speakers. Other manipulations include whether the auditory stimulus is a full sentence or a sentence fragment, and whether it is completely modally voiced, completely creaky, or partially creaky (final 40-50\% of the utterance). Results: Accuracy is lowest on partial creak, suggesting that creaky voice is least salient when it serves as an utterance-final marker. There are no strong gender effects aside from a weak tendency to identify creak more often in females than males in the whole creak condition in one experiment. In contrast, when no creak is present, listeners false alarm on the low-pitched males. Conclusion: Rates of identifying creak in male and female speakers are similar, suggesting that listeners have a comparable ability to hear creaky voice in all speakers.},

However, despite suspicions that inserted glides may be fundamentally different from lexical glides (e.g. Cruttenden 2008), a systematic phonetic investigation of the purported glide is lacking. We examine the nature of hiatus resolution by comparing three environments: (i) vowel-vowel sequences within words (VV: kiosk), (ii) vowel-vowel sequences across word boundaries (VBV: see otters), and (iii) vowel-glide-vowel sequences across word boundaries (VGV: see yachts). The first finding is that a glottal stop produced between the vowels accounts for nearly half of the responses for VBV phrases, whereas glottal stops are present in less than 5\% of the VV and the VGV conditions. Second, an acoustic comparison of VV, VBV, and VGV phrases not produced with glottal stops shows significant differences between the vowel-glide-vowel and the vowel-vowel sequences on all measures, including duration, intensity, and formants. These results indicate that American English speakers tend to resolve hiatus at word boundaries with glottal stop insertion, whereas there is no hiatus resolution at all within words. A brief optimality-theoretic analysis sketches out the phonological differences between hiatus at word boundaries and word-medially.*},

Linguistic factors such as phrase and word position, stress, and the preceding phoneme are examined and are shown to condition the presence and degree of phonation during the constriction period of stops and fricatives. The amount of phonation present is further analyzed by characterizing where in the constriction interval phonation appears. Carryover phonation (or bleed) from a preceding sonorant is most common for stops, while a trough pattern (phonation that dies out and then begins again before the end of the closure) is more prevalent for fricatives. These acoustic patterns, together with previous reports of laryngeal articulation and air pressure measures, have implications for the representation of laryngeal timing in a gestural phonology framework.},

The current study examines the voicing of stops and fricatives in the connected read speech of 37 speakers. Results confirm that phrase position, word position, lexical stress, and the manner and voicing of the adjacent sound condition the prevalence of voicing, but they have different effects on stops and fricatives. The analysis of where voicing is realized in the constriction interval shows that bleed from a preceding sonorant is common, but voicing beginning partway through the constriction interval (i.e., negative voice onset time) is much rarer. The acoustic, articulatory, and aerodynamic sources of the patterns of phonation found in connected speech are discussed.},

  abstract = {Creaky phonation (also known as creaky voice, vocal fry, laryngealization, or glottalization) is a voice quality that refers to shortened and thickened vocal folds that vibrate at a low and quasi-regular fundamental frequency with a long period of damping. Cross-linguistically, creaky phonation can span either short or long domains. When implemented on individual vowels or consonants (as in Zapotec or Montana Salish), it can signal phonemic contrast with other voice qualities, or it can be an additional acoustic cue to enhance other contrasts, such as tone (as in Mandarin or Cantonese). Another segmental use of creaky phonation in many languages is as a variant of glottal stop. Creaky phonation can also be implemented as a prosodic element that signals the end of a phrase (as in English or Mandarin), or indicates relinquishing a conversational turn (as in Finnish). It can also express meaning in a social interaction, such as irritation (in Vietnamese). Lastly, creaky phonation can be deployed as a sociolinguistic marker to establish identities, convey affect, or distinguish one speech group from another within the same language. In some social circumstances, such as the perception that young women use creaky phonation at greater rates than men do, it can be evaluated negatively by listeners. As creaky phonation can be combined with linguistic elements at various levels and is easily perceptible, it has taken on a remarkable number of roles in our linguistic repertoires.

ICPhS) argue that other kinds of creaky voice manifest only some of these properties. For example, “tense voice” is constricted but has neither a low nor irregular f0. Although tense voice is usually produced with a high f0, the aforementioned authors suggest that tense voice can also occur with non-high f0. In this study, we argue that glottalized (also known as “laryngealized”;) vowels of Zongozotla Totonac qualify as such: they are produced with tense voice but with non-high f0. Zongozotla Totonac is a Totonac-Tepehua language spoken in the municipality of Zongozotla, Puebla, Mexico. We recorded eight speakers producing nine word pairs that contrast in terms of modal versus glottalized vowels. Compared to modal vowels, glottalized vowels show increased constriction, as indexed by lower spectral tilt and weaker voicing. However, glottalized and modal vowels do not differ in terms of f0 or periodicity. Taken together, the results suggest that glottalized vowels are produced with tense voice, for which the increase in constriction is criterial. This analysis has implications for understanding sound change in Totonac as well as for the taxonomy of creaky voice subtypes.},

  abstract = {A new method to calculate a spectral harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in speech signals is presented. The method involves discrimination between harmonic and noise energy in the magnitude spectrum by means of a comb-liftering operation in the cepstrum domain. Sensitivity of HNR to (a) additive noise and (b) jitter was tested with synthetic vowel-like signals, generated at 10 fundamental frequencies. All jitter and noise signals were analyzed at three window lengths in order to investigate the effect of the length of the analysis frame on the estimated HNR values. Results of a multiple linear regression analysis with noise or jitter, F               0               , and window length as predictors for HNR indicate a major effect of both noise and jitter on HNR, in that HNR decreases almost linearly with increasing noise levels or increasing jitter. The influence of F               0               and window length on HNR is small for the jittered signals, but HNR increases considerably with increasing F               0               or window length for the noise signals. We conclude that the method seems to be a valid technique for determining the amount of spectral noise, because it is almost linearly sensitive to both noise and jitter for a large part of the noise or jitter continuum. The strong negative relation between HNR and jitter illustrates that spectral noise measures cannot simply be taken as indicators of the actual amount of noise in the time signal. Instead, HNR integrates several aspects of the acoustic stability of the signal. As such, HNR may be a useful parameter in the analysis of voice quality, although it cannot be directly interpreted in terms of underlying glottal events or perceptual characteristics.},

The study examines how coarticulatory glottalization (creaky phonation, glottal closure) coincides with coarticulatory pitch perturbations and spectral tilt changes on neighboring vowels. The onset of laryngeally induced F0 perturbation effects and the timing of changes in spectral tilt were examined using acoustic data from six speakers of the language. The results show that in contexts where substantial non-modal phonation spreads onto the adjacent vowel, greater pitch effects are observed. In contexts where abrupt glottal closure occurs, less coarticulatory changes in spectral tilt and pitch are observed on adjacent vowels. In addition, strong tonal effects are observed for certain spectral measures. These findings are discussed in relation to the literature on tonogenesis and coarticulatory pitch effects.},

In tone languages, phrasal position is a conditioning environment for processes of tone sandhi/allotony, though such patterns emerge from local processes of tonal enhancement or reduction. The current article examines the production of tone in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, an endangered language of Mexico with nine lexical tones and fixed, stem-final stress, across phrasal and utterance positions via three experiments. In the first two experiments, the findings show that speakers lengthen syllables and expand the tonal F0 range in utterance-final position. The effect of this range expansion is high tone raising, low tone lowering, and falling contour lowering. Rising contour tones undergo substantial leveling when produced in a non-utterance-final context, similar to Taiwanese Mandarin. These findings suggest that postural changes in F0 range are controlled, intonational effects in tonal languages and not paralinguistic. In the third experiment, we examine utterance-level declination and raising within sentences consisting entirely of level tones. We show that utterance-level F0 changes are independent from local tonal hyperarticulation effects in phrase-final position. Together, the experiments largely support prosodically-conditioned phonetic undershoot as a control mechanism in tone production and demonstrate how tonal complexity may constrain universal tendencies in speech production.},

  abstract = {Itunyoso Triqui (Oto-Manguean: Mexico) possesses several unique morphological derivations, each of which is typified by a toggling of glottal features at the right edge of the root. Root-final coda /?/ is deleted if it is present on uninflected stems, but inserted if it is absent. This process, traditionally known as a morphophonological exchange rule (c.f. Baerman 2007; de Lacy 2012; Wunderlich 2012), is regular and productive in the language. Moreover, it is the primary exponent of the first person singular, the topical third person, and nominal quantifier morphemes, while tonal alternations are secondary, morpheme-specific exponents. The current paper both provides the first comprehensive description of these patterns in Itunyoso Triqui and argues two theoretical points. First, Triqui glottal toggling involves a morphophonological exchange mapping (/?/ ? [?]; /?/ ? [?]) which, in coordination with syllable well-formedness conditions, produces a toggling pattern. Second, exchange mappings or rules like the Triqui toggle pose unique problems for parallelist approaches to Optimality Theory but not to serialist approaches which permit intermediate stages of representation, a finding that accords well with the necessity for multiple strata in Triqui word formation.},

It is one of three Trique languages, all of which are spoken in Oaxaca, Mexico. According to the 2005 census (INEGI 2005), there are 1,345 inhabitants in the town, virtually all of whom speak Itunyoso Trique as a native language. However, this number does not reflect the total number of speakers, as approximately 30\%–50\% of the population lives outside of San Martín Itunyoso at any given time. The population of the nearby town of Concepción Itunyoso, with a population of 261 (ibid.), is considered to speak the same dialect. The remaining populations of speakers are found in Oaxaca City, Mexico City, and the United States.},

Electroglottographic (EGG) and acoustic data were examined from original fieldwork on the Takhian Thong dialect. EGG data shows high open quotient (OQ) values for the breathy register, low OQ values for the tense register, intermediate OQ values for the modal register, and rapidly changing high to low OQ values for the breathy-tense register. Acoustic correlates indicate that H1-A3 best distinguishes between breathy and non-breathy phonation, but measures like H1-H2 and pitch are necessary to discriminate between tense and non-tense phonation. A comparison of spectral tilt and OQ measures shows the greatest correlation between OQ and H1-H2, suggesting that changes in the relative amplitude of frequencies in the upper spectrum are not directly related to changes in the open period of the glottal cycle. OQ is best correlated with changes in the degree of glottal tension.},

More recent work based on prosodic theory (Pierrehumbert \& Talkin, 1992; Pierrehumbert, 1995) has shown that prosodic constituents and prominence are important factors in the description of glottalization: word-initial vowels glottalize with higher frequency at the beginnings of intonational phrases, and to a greater degree if the word is pitch-accented. The work reported here extends Pierrehumbert \& Talkin’s findings using a different method, and reports additional dependencies on prosodic structure. The study is based on a different style of speech and a wider variety of prosodic and segmental contexts, in a speech corpus that was produced with communicative intent (FM radio news style, 3709 word-initial vowels produced by five speakers, three female and two male). Analysis of this corpus shows that glottalization of word-initial vowels is influenced by fullvs.intermediate intonational phrase boundaries and pitch accent on the target syllable or word, but the effect of the preceding segmental context is small in comparison. These results are robust despite substantial interspeaker differences in both the distribution and nature of glottal onsets, and illustrate the value of revisiting earlier morphosyntactic analyses with prosodic structure in mind.},

Despite the great importance of variogram estimators in predicting geostatistical features, they are commonly influenced by outliers in the dataset. The effect of some randomly spatially distributed outliers can mask the pattern of the experimental variogram and produce a destructuration effect, implying that the true data spatial continuity cannot be reproduced. In this paper, an algorithm to detect and remove the effect of outliers in experimental variograms using the Mahalanobis distance is proposed. An example of the algorithm’s application is presented, showing that the developed technique is able to satisfactorily detect and remove outliers from a variogram.},

  abstract = {The Nuosu (Nosu) Yi language, or Northern Yi (北部彝语), is spoken by approximately two million people in southern Sichuan Province and northern Yunnan Province, China, the majority of whom are monolingual. Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson \& Ladefoged (1985) and Sun \& Liu (1986).},

  abstract = {The phonology-phonetics interface is broadly concerned with the question of how abstract knowledge of a language's sound system influences and is influenced by the physical processes of producing and perceiving speech. There are a multitude of models that aim to address this question, many of which make distinct and even contradictory claims. This dissertation uses evidence from tone and phonation in San Martín Peras Mixtec (SMPM; ISO: jmx) to narrow the hypothesis space of viable frameworks of the interface, arguing that two basic characteristics must hold of any successful approach. First, drawing from phonetic and phonological analysis of a highly-specific process of low tone spread in SMPM, I argue that phonological and phonetic units of representation are defined at distinct levels of granularity, and therefore that they constitute distinct levels of representation. By extension, if any framework is to successfully derive low tone spread, it must incorporate different levels of representation for phonology and phonetics. Second, I show that a rate-driven, phonetic process of laryngeal reduction in SMPM influences the application of a phonological alternation, which provides evidence that the language's phonetic system is able to non-trivially influence which phonological output makes it to the surface. I argue that, in order to account for laryngeal reduction in SMPM, any successful model of the interface must allow for phonetics to influence phonology, though this influence must be indirect. Finally, I outline a model of Phonetically-Informed Candidate Selections (PICS) that embodies these characteristics and compare it with other frameworks that implement the required characteristics somewhat differently, outlining the distinct typological predictions and empirical coverage of each approach. Ultimately, this dissertation aims to constrict the hypothesis space of potential approaches to the phonology-phonetics interface, with the ultimate goal of pushing forward the field's understanding of the nature of language users' multi-tiered knowledge about the sound systems of their languages.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effects of prosody on voice quality variations in American English sentences. Research on voice quality variations in English requires both taking into account the various linguistic sources for changes in voice quality and adequately tracking and measuring the range of naturally occurring voice qualities in English. For instance, several consonants in English have glottal stop allophones that can cause glottalization of the preceding vowel, and there are personal and regional variations in voice quality. In this study, these effects are controlled by obtaining an idiosyncratic baseline value for each measurement for each word of the corpus. Furthermore, voice quality variations are tracked using both quantitative measurements (derived from the Liljencrants/Fant (LF) model of the glottal source) and a qualitative description of the waveforms to capture the range of voice qualities in the corpus. Modeled source pulses were evaluated to calculate the measurements OQ (open quotient), RK (glottal skew), EE (spectral intensity) and Linearity (spectral linearity). Samples were taken from 3 speakers producing variants of a single sentence. Tokens included interrogative and declarative sentences, and sentences with phrase-initial and phrase-final prominent words. Results show that there are consistent effects of prominence and phrase boundaries on voice quality, both across speakers and among measurements. Both prominent words and phrase-initial words displayed a “tenser” voice quality than their non-prominent and phrase-final counterparts. A tense voice quality is associated in theory with greater compression of the vocal fold and greater force of closure of the arytenoids. Acoustically, tense voice quality is correlated with low values of open quotient and glottal skew, and high values of spectral intensity and spectral linearity. On the other hand, changes in tense or lax voice quality were not correlated with changes in pitch, nor were there any effects of pitch accent type or boundary tone on modal voice quality. There was, however, an increase in non-modal phonation associated with Low boundary tones, but not with low phonetic pitch in general.},

Thirty-two speakers were recorded producing words with all seven tones; audio and electroglottographic recordings were made. Acoustic measures were: cepstral peak prominence (CPP), H1⁎, H2⁎, H1⁎−H2⁎, H1⁎−A1⁎, H1⁎−A2⁎, H1⁎−A3⁎, and H2⁎−H4⁎. Electroglottographic (EGG) measures were: closed quotient and derivative-EGG closure peak amplitude (DECPA). F0 and duration were measured. Results showed that the traditional tonal descriptions are accurate except for the high-level tone which is better described as rising and the mid-low tone, which is falling. Furthermore, the rising and low-falling tones are shorter than the other five tones. In terms of acoustic and electroglottographic measures, none of the measures tested distinguished all three phonation types at a given time point. Several measures, H1⁎, H1⁎−H2⁎, CQ, CPP, and DECPA, distinguished two phonation categories, suggesting that phonation contrasts are realized across several phonetic dimensions. Additional results showed that many of the acoustic and EGG measures were correlated with F0 and that closed quotient and DECPA were most strongly correlated with H1⁎−H2⁎.},

Results from the two languages are strikingly similar: only the early timing and increased magnitude of the various acoustic reflexes of breathiness phonetically distinguish phonemic consonantal breathiness from phonemic vocalic breathiness.},

  abstract = {Across languages, the acoustic and articulatory correlates of breathiness are similar whether they are associated with consonants or with vowels. This raises the question of whether breathy consonants are confusable with breathy vowels in languages in which a phonemically breathy vowel contrasts with a phonemically modal vowel that follows a breathy-aspirated consonant, e.\,g. Gujarati /ba̤ɾ/ ‘outside’ vs. /bʱaɾ/ ‘burden’, respectively. We investigate the perception of a minimal triplet of Gujarati words, with a breathy vowel vs. a breathy consonant vs. an all-modal sequence, via three tasks: free-sort, AX discrimination, and picture-matching identification. Results across the three tasks indicate that breathiness is indeed confusable across the association types. Specifically, while listeners do recognize the stronger breathiness in vowels following breathy consonants, they are not necessarily able to determine whether that breathiness is associated with the vowel or the consonant. Furthermore, they do not reliably recognize the subtler breathiness of breathy vowels, which often indicates that they are the same as or an acceptable realization of an all-modal sequence (/baɾ/ ‘twelve’). This suggests a potential perceptual merger in Gujarati, despite previously-reported evidence of a robust three-way contrast in production.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies on phonation types have focused on low vowels due to the minimal effects of their first formant on harmonic amplitude. In studies of multiple vowel qualities, reports on the relationship between vowel and voice quality are mixed: some show similar formant frequencies across phonation types (e.g. Abramson, Nye \& Luangthongkum 2007, Khan 2012), while others show different formant frequencies depending on voice quality (e.g. Ren 1992, Kuang 2011). Results differ as to whether the degree of non-modal phonation varies (Andruski \& Ratliff 2000, Kuang 2011) or does not vary (Esposito 2012, Khan 2012) across different vowel qualities. The present study draws on innovations which allow for more accurate corrections for the effects of formant frequencies on spectral measures (i.e. Hanson 1995, Iseli, Shue \& Alwan 2007) to examine the relationship between vowel quality and voice quality, in eight languages – !Xóõ, Burmese, Gujarati, Jalapa de Díaz Mazatec, Mon, Santa Ana del Valle Zapotec, White Hmong, and Yi. While no significant difference in the degree of non-modal phonation due to vowel quality was found, results showed a crosslinguistic pattern in the relationship between vowel quality and voice quality: vowels with higher log(F1) and log(F2) values tended to be produced with creakier phonation, while vowels with lower log(F1) and log(F2) values tended to be produced with breathier phonation, but only on the measure H1*-H2*.},

Male and female speakers produced words in five prosodie positions: isolation (with focus, F0 higher than sentence-medial position), initial (focused, high F0), isolation (without focus, mid-range F0), medial (midrange F0), final (lower F0). Two acoustic measures of phonation, H1-H2 and H1-A3, were made for each vowel. Results were inconclusive as to whether one gender was creakier or breathier than the other, though they did suggest that there was a difference in the production of phonation. In addition, there was also a strong effect of F0 on phonation, but not of position independently of F0. While the three-way phonation contrast was present in all five prosodie positions, it was not always well-defined. The contrast was minimized in isolation with focus (high F0) and initial position (high F0). The results obtained indicate that there is variation in phonation, even in a language with contrastive phonation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an acoustic and physiological analysis of the Danish ‘stød’ with an introduction on its phonological role and distribution. The stød is a prosodic feature bound to definite syllables in certain word types and connected to the latter part of the syllable. Phonetically it is a phonation type related to creaky voice. The first part of the syllable is characterized acoustically by a higher pitch level and often a higher intensity level than syllables without stød, and by a relatively high subglottal pressure and airflow, thus generally by a relatively high expenditure of energy. In the second part, the stød phase proper, there is a considerable decrease in intensity, particularly in the lower part of the spectrum and, for the majority of the speakers, a noticeable decrease in fundamental frequency, and/or aperiodicity. Moreover the airflow is low, and inverse filtering shows a longer closure time in each vibration. There is also a slight decrease in subglottal pressure, and all speakers have a constriction of the vocal folds and often of the ventricular folds as well, but with large interindividual variation as to the degree of constriction. On the boundary between the first and the second phase most speakers have a strong contraction of the vocalis and lateralis muscles, obviously preparing for the glottal constriction of the second phase. The author cannot follow Svend Smith in concluding that a sudden contraction and relaxation of the respiratory muscles resulting in a quick rise and fall in subglottal pressure constitutes the primary factor. There is, rather, an independent contraction of a number of muscles, and neither the high pitch at the beginning nor the fall in pitch and intensity in the second phase can be explained by the subglottal pressure contour. The high pitch level at the beginning may be explained by activity in the cricothyroid, and the decrease in pitch and the low intensity in the second phase is probably due to constriction of the glottis, although the fact that the decrease in intensity starts rather early raises some problems. Finally the question of the origin of the stød is discussed briefly. It is suggested that the stød in Danish perhaps originated from a reinforcement of the first syllable in combination with reduction and loss of a following syllable in Common Scandinavian. The reinforcement may have been accompanied by a rise in pitch, so that developments in different directions (involving stød or tonal accents) were possible.},

  abstract = {In many languages with clitic or other weak pronouns, a Person-Case Constraint (Perlmutter 1971, Bonet 1991) prohibits certain combinations of these pronouns on the basis of their person features. This article explores the crosslinguistic variation in such constraints, starting with several closely related Zapotec varieties. These restrict combinations of clitics not just on the basis of person, but also on the basis of a finely articulated, largely animacy-based gender system. Operating within a larger combinatorial space, these constraints offer a new perspective on the typology of Phi-Case Constraints (ΦCCs) more generally. This typology has an overall asymmetrical shape correlating with the underlying syntactic position of pronominal arguments. We develop a principled theory of this typology that incorporates three hypotheses: (a) ΦCCs arise from how a functional head Agrees with clitic pronouns, subject to intervention-based locality (Anagnostopoulou 2003, Béjar and Rezac 2003, 2009); (b) the variation in these constraints arises from variation in the relativization of probes (Anagnostopoulou 2005, Nevins 2007, 2011); and (c) clitic and other weak pronouns have no inherent need to be licensed via Agree with a functional head. Under this account, the crosslinguistic typology of ΦCCs has the potential to shed light on the grammatical representation of person and gender.},

  abstract = {San Felipe Jalapa de Díaz (Jalapa) Mazatec is unusual in possessing a three-way phonation contrast and three-way level tone contrast independent of phonation. This study investigates the acoustics of how phonation and tone interact in this language, and how such interactions are maintained across variables like speaker sex, vowel timecourse, and presence of aspiration in the onset. Using a large number of words from the recordings of Mazatec made by Paul Kirk and Peter Ladefoged in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of our acoustic and statistical analysis support the claim that spectral measures like H1-H2 and mid-range spectral measures like H1-A2 best distinguish each phonation type, though other measures like Cepstral Peak Prominence are important as well. This is true regardless of tone and speaker sex. The phonation type contrasts are strongest in the first third of the vowel and then weaken towards the end. Although the tone categories remain distinct from one another in terms of F0 throughout the vowel, for laryngealized phonation the tone contrast in F0 is partially lost in the initial third. Consistent with phonological work on languages that cross-classify tone and phonation type (i.e. ‘laryngeally complex’ languages, Silverman 1997), this study shows that the complex orthogonal three-way phonation and tone contrasts do remain acoustically distinct according to the measures studied, despite partial neutralizations in any given measure.},

These complex articulations in turn produce a multidimensional acoustic output that can be modeled in various ways. In this study, I investigate whether the psychoacoustic model of voice by Kreiman et al. (2014) succeeds at distinguishing six phonation types of !Xóõ. Linear discriminant analysis is performed using parameters from the model averaged over the entire vowel as well as for the first and final halves of the vowel. The results indicate very high classification accuracy for all phonation types. Measures averaged over the vowel’s entire duration are closely correlated with the discriminant functions, suggesting that they are sufficient for distinguishing even dynamic phonation types. Measures from all classes of parameters are correlated with the linear discriminant functions; in particular, the “strident” vowels, which are harsh in quality, are characterized by their noise, changes in spectral tilt, decrease in voicing amplitude and frequency, and raising of the first formant. Despite the large number of contrasts and the time-varying characteristics of many of the phonation types, the phonation contrasts in !Xóõ remain well differentiated acoustically.},

  abstract = {Hmong languages, particularly White Hmong, are well studied for their complex tone systems that incorporate pitch, phonation, and duration differences. Still, prior work has made use mostly of tones elicited in their citation forms in carrier phrases. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of both the vowel and tone systems of White Hmong from recordings of read speech. We confirm several features of the language, including the presence of nasal vowels (rather than derived nasalized vowels through coarticulation with a coda [ŋ]), the description of certain tone contours, and the systematic presence of breathy and creaky voice on two of the tones. We also find little evidence of additional intonational f0 targets. However, we show that some tones vary greatly by their position in utterance, and propose novel descriptions for several of them. Finally, we show that                                                                      \$\textbackslash textrm\{H\}1\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash!*\}\$                                               –H2               *               , a widely used measure of voice quality and phonation in Hmong and across languages, does not adequately distinguish modal from non-modal phonation in this data set, and argue that noise measures like Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) are more robust to phonation differences in corpora with more variability.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates how glottal stops are produced and perceived, and why they occur so frequently before word-initial vowels in languages of the world. Specifically, the goal of the production chapter was to determine whether glottal stops are truly glottal sounds. High-speed imaging of glottal stops uttered by five phonetically-trained English speakers was obtained using trans-oral videoendoscopy. When produced as plosives, glottal stops always had some form of vocal fold incursion, though full glottal closure is not always observed. Moreover, glottal stops were usually - but not always - accompanied by ventricular incursion. Glottal stops are thus necessarily glottal but not necessarily ventricular sounds. The timing of ventricular incursion suggests that it may be used to sustain, rather than produce, glottal closure.The specific goal of the perception study was to determine whether glottal stops are perceived distinctly from phrase-final creak, which shares similar acoustic features to glottalization. Sixteen English listeners were asked to identify words with glottal stops as allophones of /t/, e.g. 'button,' 'atlas,' and 'dent.' They were also presented with near-minimal pairs with no glottal stop, e.g. 'bun,' 'Alice,' and 'den.' The target words either had creak or no creak. The results indicate that words with glottal stop allophones are more accurately and more confidently identified when no creak is present, when the glottal stop is acoustically longer, and/or when the glottal stop is word-medial. Moreover, glottal stops are more accurately identified in creak when they occur in 'button'-type words, compared with worse identification in 'atlas'- and 'dent'-type words. For words with no glottal stops (e.g., 'bun,' 'Alice,' and 'den'), the presence of creak does not render them confusable with words with glottal allophones, except for 'den'-type words where word-final creak is sometimes mistaken for a glottal stop. Thus, glottal stops are generally harder to detect in creak, but are mutually confusable with creak only word-finally after nasals.To determine why and when glottal stops occur word-initially, the occurrence of word-initial full glottal stops in an English corpus was analyzed using logistic mixed-effects regression modeling. Prominence and phrasing are overwhelmingly the most important factors in predicting full glottal stop occurrence in English. Moreover, prominent word-initial vowels that are not preceded by full glottal stops show acoustic correlates of glottal constriction, whereas non-prominent phrase-initial vowels do not. Rather, phrase-initial voicing (even for sonorants) is less regular, but in a manner inconsistent with glottal constriction. These findings were subsequently confirmed using articulatory measures from electroglottography, and extended to Spanish. Based on the results, a prominence-driven theory of word-initial glottalization is proposed and motivated, with higher phrasal domains responsible only for the relative strength of the glottal stop gesture. Glottalization before word-initial vowels is thus a marker of prominence and is used amplify cues to prominence when they would otherwise be weakened.},

Here I focus on what we have learnt over these years about the linguistic sources of voice quality modulation. I stress how voice quality has a role to play in all of speech: among its many functions, the voice is involved in the articulation of all sounds, and voice quality is worth investigating as much for “modal” consonants and vowels as for contrastive phonation type. The voice also encodes structure at many prosodic levels: sub-lexical, lexical, and post-lexical. I further highlight some of the important technological developments and refinement of various voice quality models that have led to progress in the phonetic study of voice quality. Reviewing all of the above, one can only conclude that human voice has a central role to play in the phonetician’s pursuit towards understanding spoken language.},

This study investigates the acoustics of breathy-to-creaky phonation contours in vowels from a production study of native speakers of English and White Hmong. These languages differ in the nature of the non-modal phonation types. In the English corpus, both the breathiness and creakiness are non-contrastive. In the Hmong corpus, the breathiness can be contrastive or a result of coarticulation with a neighboring segment, but the creakiness is always contrastive. The contours were analyzed using the three measures of phonation that were found to best differentiate non-modal from modal phonation in these languages: H1⁎–H2⁎, H1⁎–A1⁎, and harmonics-to-noise ratio. Results from these measures provide support for the presence of breathy–creaky contours in vowels. The timing and sequencing of the breathy and creaky phonation types are largely dependent on whether they are contrastive, with contrastive non-modal phonation being present during more portions of the vowel than non-modal phonation derived from coarticulation. The acoustic results also provide evidence for simultaneous breathy and creaky phonation types in Hmong.},

  abstract = {Tongan (lea fakatonga, ISO 639-3 code ton) is a Polynesian language spoken mainly in Tonga, where it is one of two official languages (with English). There are about 104,000 speakers of the language in Tonga, with nearly 80,000 additional speakers elsewhere (Simons \& Fennig 2017). It is most closely related to Niuean, and more distantly related to West Polynesian languages (such as Tokelauan and Samoan) and East Polynesian languages (such as Hawaiian, Māori, and Tahitian). Previous work on the phonetics and phonology of Tongan includes a general grammar (Churchward 1953), a dissertation with a grammatical overview (Taumoefolau 1998), a phonological sketch of the language (Feldman 1978), two dictionaries (Churchward 1959, Tu‘inukuafe 1992), journal and working papers on stress (Taumoefolau 2002, Garellek \& White 2015), intonation (Kuo \& Vicenik 2012), as well as the ‘definitive accent’ (discussed below) and the phonological status of identical vowel sequences (Poser 1985; Condax 1989; Schütz 2001; Anderson \& Otsuka 2003, 2006; Garellek \& White 2010; Ahn 2016; Zuraw 2018). This illustration is meant to provide an overview of the phonetic structures of the language, and includes novel acoustic data on its three-way word-initial laryngeal contrasts, which are cross-linguistically rare. The recordings accompanying this illustration come from Veiongo Hehepoto, a native speaker of Tongan currently living in Melbourne, Australia. Ms. Veiongo was born in 1950 on the island of Vava‘u (northern Tonga), but grew up and was educated in the capital city Nuku‘alofa on Tongatapu (see Figure~1). She moved to Vanuatu when she was 16 years old, and when she was 21 moved to Australia where she trained as a nurse. She continues to speak Tongan every day with family members (including children, who were born in Australia) and friends.},

This suggests that word-initial glottalization may arise from prosodic strengthening – the phenomenon by which sounds are more ‘strongly’ articulated in stronger prosodic positions. However, if word-initial glottalization is due to prosodic strengthening, what exactly is being strengthened? The goal of this study is to determine whether voice quality is strengthened in vowels and sonorants, and whether this type of strengthening is consistent with word-initial glottalization. Prominent and/or phrase-initial voicing in English and Spanish was analyzed articulatorily using electroglottography. The results reveal that voicing during word-initial vowels in English and Spanish has increased contact under prominence, but not at phrasal onsets. Non-prominent initial vowels and sonorants are characterized by a decrease in contact, which I argue is inconsistent with both word-initial glottalization and voice quality strengthening. Based on the results, a prominence-driven account of word-initial glottalization is proposed and motivated.},

  abstract = {Variation in voicing is common among sounds of the world’s languages: sounds that are analyzed as voiceless can undergo voicing, and those analyzed as voiced can devoice. Among voiceless glottal sounds in particular, voicing is widespread: linguists often expect the voiceless glottal stop [ʔ] and fricative [h] to be fully voiced, especially between vowels. In this study, we use audio recordings from Illustrations of the International Phonetic Alphabet published in the               Journal of the International Phonetic Association               to explore the extent to which glottal consonants and non-modal (breathy and creaky) vowels differ in terms of percentage voicing and voicing intensity in three phrasal positions. We find that voiceless [h] is only slightly less voiced than voiced [ɦ] in initial position. Between two vowels, both [h] and [ɦ] are as voiced as breathy vowels. Glottal stops and creaky vowels are both characterized by high percentages of voicing, but they differ in voicing intensity: in all phrasal positions, glottal stops generally have periods of strong and weak voicing, whereas creaky vowels are strongly voiced. In contrast, vowels described as ‘rearticulated’, ‘checked’, or ‘glottalized’ show similar drops in voicing intensity to glottal stops. We interpret these results through an articulatory lens: glottal consonants and non-modal vowels are both modulations in phonation resulting from laryngeal constriction and vocal fold spreading. We argue further that, because voicing during [ʔ] and [h] is largely predictable from respiratory and prosodic constraints, many cases of [ʔ] and [h] can be considered phonetically underspecified for voicing.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the production and perception of contrastively laryngealized vowels in Coatzospan Mixtec (CM), an Otomanguean language of southern Mexico. A production study focuses on four dimensions of the phonetics of contrastively laryngealized vowels for eight speakers: f0 excursions, amplitude drop, amplitude differences between the first and second harmonics, and overall vowel duration. The production study reveals that the implementation of laryngealized vowels is highly variable within and across speakers, and that these vowels cannot be characterized as creaky voiced, but rather must be viewed as produced along a continuum on which creaky voicing constitutes only the most extreme of one of the ends. Strikingly, it is shown that many tokens are realized with highly subtle cues, involving only minimal drops along the f0 and amplitude dimensions. Three perception experiments conducted in a field setting using synthetic speech examined the contributions of f0 drops and amplitude in cueing the percept of laryngealized vowels. These studies agree with the production data in that they reveal speakers to be highly tuned to small changes along the f0 and amplitude dimensions in the experimental stimuli. Taken together, the production and perception data (1) add to our knowledge of the phonetics of an underdescribed and endangered language; (2) add to our knowledge of how phonation types such as laryngealization on vowels can be implemented cross-linguistically; and (3) provide a more finely grained notion of the array of acoustic cues that implement the categorical, contrastive phonological property of vowel laryngealization. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Descriptions of such phonation abound, but variations in scope, purpose, terminology, measurement technique, and level of description make it difficult to compare vocal phenomena across disciplines, or even across studies within a single discipline. We demonstrate how hypotheses about which kinds of nonmodal phonation types are the same and which are different can be tested by studies of listeners' perceptions. Evidence suggests that period-doubled phonation, amplitude modulations, and vocal fry form perceptually distinctive qualities, which also have consistent acoustic and physiological correlates. Evidence is much more ambiguous for qualities like breathiness and creak, which vary continuously from modal phonation. A common theoretical framework for the description of vocal quality may eventually eliminate many impediments to unified description.},

  abstract = {In linear mixed models, model selection frequently includes the selection of random effects. Two versions of the Akaike information criterion, aic, have been used, based either on the marginal or on the conditional distribution. We show that the marginal aic is not an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the Akaike information, and favours smaller models without random effects. For the conditional aic, we show that ignoring estimation uncertainty in the random effects covariance matrix, as is common practice, induces a bias that can lead to the selection of any random effect not predicted to be exactly zero. We derive an analytic representation of a corrected version of the conditional aic, which avoids the high computational cost and imprecision of available numerical approximations. An implementation in an R package (R Development Core Team, 2010) is provided. All theoretical results are illustrated in simulation studies, and their impact in practice is investigated in an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Zambia.},

In one, stød is an autonomous laryngeal syllable prosody. In the other, stød is the phonetic manifestation of an HL tonal pattern compressed within one syllable. The tonal representation is found to be contradicted by the phonetic reality, and it cannot account for the structurally determined alternation between non-stød and stød in inflection and derivation, nor for latent stød or stød in compounds. Furthermore, stød patterns are largely constant across regional varieties of Danish, but tonal patterns over the relevant structural domains are highly variable. Thus, stød may occur on any kind of tonal configuration, anywhere in the speaker's pitch range, a variability which is hard to reconcile with a fixed HL representation.},

We argue that this phenomenon can be accounted for by considering that there are two completive prefixes, the segmental exponents of which are the same: one that does not provoke any tone change (completive) and the other that does (completive 2). We also propose that this tone change can be considered as an instance of a grammatical tone, especially the nondominant grammatical tone, where the grammatical tone interacts with the lexical tone of its host. The phenomenon discussed in this paper is of interest because the interaction of syntax and tone has not been studied in detail in Zapotec or more generally in Otomanguean languages.},

  abstract = {The aim of the research reported in this paper is to formulate a set of acoustic parameters of the voicing source that reflect individual differences in the voice qualities of female speakers. Theoretical analysis and observations of experimental data suggest that a more open glottal configuration results in a glottal volume-velocity waveform with relatively greater low-frequency and weaker high-frequency components, compared to a waveform produced with a more adducted glottal configuration. The more open glottal configuration also leads to a greater source of aspiration noise and larger bandwidths of the natural frequencies of the vocal tract, particularly the first formant. These different attributes of the glottal waveform can be measured directly from the speech spectrum or waveform. A set of acoustic parameters that are likely to indicate glottal characteristics is described. These parameters are measured in the speech of a group of female speakers, and the glottal configurations of the speakers are hypothesized. This research contributes to the description of normal variations of voicing characteristics across speakers and to a continuing effort to improve the analysis and synthesis of female speech. It may also have applications in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Likelihood-based regression models such as the normal linear regression model and the linear logistic model, assume a linear (or some other parametric) form for the covariates \$X\_1, X\_2, \textbackslash cdots, X\_p\$. We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form \$\textbackslash sum \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ by a sum of smooth functions \$\textbackslash sum s\_j(X\_j)\$. The \$s\_j(\textbackslash cdot)\$'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor \$\textbackslash eta = \textbackslash Sigma \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ is replaced by the additive predictor \$\textbackslash Sigma s\_j(X\_j)\$; hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

These two constructions combine to form 19 different tone classes (i.e., groups of verbs that follow similar tone alternation patterns). I describe these constructions in terms of two of the more recent typologies of grammatical tone phenomena (Palancar 2016; Rolle 2018), and I discuss how the analysis of verb inflection in Tenango Otomi contributes to such typologies. Furthermore, I propose two different accounts for the apparent irregularities in the inflection system presented, one based on (morpho)phonological rules and another one based on a word-and-paradigm model.},

The purpose of the present study was to extend these results to speakers with laryngeal pathologies and to conduct tests using connected speech in addition to sustained vowels. Breathiness ratings were obtained from a sustained vowel and a 12-word sentence spoken by 20 pathological and 5 nonpathological talkers. Acoustic measures were made of (a) signal periodicity, (b) first harmonic amplitude, and (c) spectral tilt. For the sustained vowels, a frequency domain measure of periodicity provided the most accurate predictions of perceived breathiness, accounting for 92\% of the variance in breathiness ratings. The relative amplitude of the first harmonic and two measures of spectral tilt correlated moderately with breathiness ratings. For the sentences, both signal periodicity and spectral tilt provided accurate predictions of breathiness ratings, accounting for 70\%-85\% of the variance.},

  abstract = {This study examines measures of the glottal airflow waveform, the electroglottographic signal (EGG), amplitude differences between peaks in the acoustic spectrum, and observations of the spectral energy content of the third formant (F3), in terms of how they relate to one another. Twenty females with normal voices served as subjects. Both group and individual data were studied. Measurements were made for the vowel in two speech tasks: strings of the syllable /pae/ and sustained phonation of /e/, which were produced at two levels of vocal effort: comfortable and loud voice. The main results were: 1. Significant differences in parameter values between /pTe/ and /a/ were related to significant differences in the sound pressure level (SPL). 2. An "adduction quotient," measured from the glottal waveform at a 30\% criterion, was sensitive enough to differentiate between waveforms reflecting abrupt versus gradual vocal fold closing movements. 3. DC flow showed weak or nonsignificant relationships with acoustic measures. 4. The spectral content in the third formant (F3) in comfortable loudness typically consisted of a mix of noise and harmonic energy. Inloud voice, the F3 spectral content typically consisted of harmonic energy. 5. Significant differences were found in all measures between tokens with F3 harmonic energy and tokens with F3 noise, independent of loudness condition. 6. Strong relationships between flow- and EGG-adduction quotients suggested that these signals can be used to complement each other. 7. The amplitude difference between spectral peaks of the first and third formant (F1 -F3) was found to add information about abruptness of airflow decrease (flow declination) that may be lost in the glottal waveform signal due to low-pass filtering. The results are discussed in terms of how an integrated use of these measures can contribute to a better understanding of the normal vocal mechanism and help to improve methods for evaluating vocal function.},

  abstract = {The effects of age, sex, and vocal tract configuration on the glottal excitation signal in speech are only partially understood, yet understanding these effects is important for both recognition and synthesis of speech as well as for medical purposes. In this paper, three acoustic measures related to the voice source are analyzed for five vowels from 3145 CVC utterances spoken by 335 talkers (8–39years old) from the CID database [Miller et al., Proceedings of ICASSP, 1996, Vol. 2, pp. 849–852]. The measures are: the fundamental frequency (F0), the difference between the “corrected” (denoted by an asterisk) first two spectral harmonic magnitudes, H1*−H2* (related to the open quotient), and the difference between the “corrected” magnitudes of the first spectral harmonic and that of the third formant peak, H1*−A3* (related to source spectral tilt). The correction refers to compensating for the influence of formant frequencies on spectral magnitude estimation. Experimental results show that the three acoustic measures are dependent to varying degrees on age and vowel. Age dependencies are more prominent for male talkers, while vowel dependencies are more prominent for female talkers suggesting a greater vocal tract-source interaction. All talkers show a dependency of F0 on sex and on F3, and of H1*−A3* on vowel type. For low-pitched talkers (F0⩽175Hz), H1*−H2* is positively correlated with F0 while for high-pitched talkers, H1*−H2* is dependent on F1 or vowel height. For high-pitched talkers there were no significant sex dependencies of H1*−H2* and H1*−A3*. The statistical significance of these results is shown.},

  abstract = {The Mixtec languages are members of the Mixtecan branch of the Otomanguean language family, one of the largest and most important linguistic groups of Mesoamerica. Mixtec is presently spoken by 250,000 persons living in the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Puebla and Geuerrero. A combination of the methodologies of modern dialectology and historical-comparative linguistics is applied to a large body of published and unpublished material from the Mixtec languages and dialects. A structural framework for interpreting the data is provided by the analysis and comparison of 16 modern Mixtec phonological systems. This comparison also provides support for hypotheses about the Proto-Mixtec phonological system. An overview of the reconstructed units and other phonological characteristics of Proto-Mixtec is followed by a detailed presentation of the vowel correspondences for the six Proto-Mixtec vowels and their developments into the modern varieties. Data presented in support of this reconstruction include 188 cognate sets drawn from 122 varieties of Mixtec. From the patterns of regional development revealed by this analysis and reconstruction, inferences are drawn concerning prehistoric population movements and spheres of cultural influence within the Mixtec speaking area. Stages of diversification are proposed, corresponding to the periods of action of major phonological processes. Although subgrouping by genealogical classification is not attempted, a grouping into dialect areas is achieved by a combination of diagnostic linguistic features, both phonological and lexical. These areal groupings are suggested as candidates for the reconstruction of intermediate stages between Proto-Mixtec and the modern varieties.},

Our sample of eleven languages includes languages with contrastive modal, breathy, creaky, lax, tense, harsh, and/or pharyngealized phonations, and languages with allophonic nonmodal phonation on particular tones. In compiling and analyzing this sample we address related issues such as contrast vs. allophony, phonetic similarity across languages, and understanding complex contrasts of several multidimensional phonetic categories via data reduction. Based on extensive acoustic analysis, all of the languages’ phonations were mapped into a single phonetic space, which exhibits dispersion (languages with more categories use more of the space). The space is largely two-dimensional, with dimensions that can be interpreted phonetically (e.g. dimension 2 is like a traditional breathy-to-creaky continuum) and also can be related back to the acoustic measures that structure them, thus indicating which acoustic measures are most important across languages.*},

For Gujarati, Hmong, and Yi, two electroglottographic (EGG) measures were also compared; a Contact Quotient measure distinguished the within-language phonation types in all three languages. While several acoustic measures distinguished phonation types within each language, only H1*H2* did so in all four languages. However, when each within-language phonation category was then compared across languages, each category was found to differ from language to language on multiple acoustic measures, e.g. breathy in Hmong is distinct from breathy in Gujarati. This unexpected result suggests that language/speaker differences in voice quality are larger than phonation category differences. This suggestion finds support in a Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis of the acoustic measures. A three-dimensional space turns out to mostly distinguish the languages, less so the phonations.

Tone and phonation type contrasts are used independently. This paper investigates the acoustic realization of modal, breathy, and creaky vowels; the timing of phonation in non-modal vowels; and the production of tone in combination with different phonation types. The results of cepstral peak prominence and three spectral tilt measures showed that phonation type contrasts are not distinguished by the same acoustic measures for women and men. In line with expectations for laryngeally complex languages, phonetic modal and non-modal phonation are sequenced in phonological breathy and creaky vowels. With respect to the timing pattern, however, the results show that non-modal phonation is not, as previously reported, mainly located in the middle of the vowel. Non-modal phonation is, instead, predominantly realized in the second half of phonological breathy and creaky vowels. Tone is distinguished in all three phonation types, and non-modal vowels do not exhibit distinct F0 ranges except for creaky vowels produced by women in which F0 declines in the creaky portion. The results of the acoustic analysis provide additional insights to phonological accounts of laryngeal complexity in Chichimec.},

  abstract = {The current study examines (near-)minimal pairs of breathy and modal phonation produced by ten native speakers of Gujarati in connected speech, across different vowel qualities and separated by nine equal timepoints of vowel duration. The results identify five spectral measures (i.e. H1–H2, H2–H4, H1–A1, H1–A2, H1–A3), four noise measures (i.e. cepstral peak prominence and three measures of harmonics-to-noise ratio), and one electroglottographic measure (i.e. CQ) as reliable indicators of breathy phonation, revealing a considerably larger inventory of cues to breathy phonation than what had previously been reported for the language. Furthermore, while the spectral measures are consistently distinct for breathy and modal vowels when averaging across timepoints, the efficacy of the four noise measures in distinguishing phonation categories is localized to the midpoint of the vowel's duration. This indicates that the magnitude of breathiness, especially in terms of aperiodicity, changes as a function of time. The current study supports that breathy voice in Gujarati is a dynamic, multidimensional feature, surfacing through multiple acoustic cues that are potentially relevant to the listener.},

  abstract = {Amuzgo (Otomanguean: Mexico) has a large inventory of lexically arbitrary tonal inflection classes in person/number paradigms, where inflectional tones overwrite the root's lexical tone. In causatives, however, inflectional tones are predictable from phonological properties of the root, primarily lexical tone. The inertness of root inflection classes in causatives is argued to follow from cyclicity: once the causative Voice head triggers spell-out, lexical inflection-class specifications are no longer visible, and only phonological information can condition allomorphy in the outer domain of person/number agreement. The grammatical behaviour of inflectional tone thus reflects its structural morphosyntactic position, as distinct from its linear phonological one. I distinguish between several possible analyses of phonologically conditioned tonal-overwriting allomorphy, and propose that the Amuzgo case involves constraint-mediated competition among a priority-ranked list of allomorphs in the input, rather than creation of tonal allomorph candidates purely within the phonology or subcategorisation frames in the lexical representations of allomorphs.},

  abstract = {The mismatch between phonological and phonetic representationsThe division of the stream of speech into a string of discrete segments represents the number of places where contrast between the current speech event and others is possible. Discrete segments may be employed not only to represent phonological contrasts in speech events, however, but also in the plans for actually uttering them. Beyond isomorphism with phonological representations, the appropriateness of discrete segments at some level in the plans speakers employ to produce utterances is demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of speech errors reorder entire segments rather than parts of segments or features (Shattuck- Hufnagel and Klatt 1979). This speech error evidence does not, however, reveal whether a segment-sized unit is employed at all levels in the plan for producing an utterance, nor what principles govern the coordination of articulators.Since more than one articulator is moving or otherwise active at any point in time in a speech event, the notion of a segment implies a specification for how these independent movements are coordinated. However, articulatory records of speech events cannot be divided into discrete intervals in which all movement of articulators for each segment begins and ends at the same time, nor can these records be obtained by a simple mapping from discrete underlying phonological segments. The continuous and coarticulatory properties of actual speech events instead make it very unlikely that the plans for producing them consist of nothing more than a string of discrete segments (Ohman 1966, 1967; Fowler 1980; Browman and Goldstein 1985, 1986; but cf. Henke 1966; Keating 1985).},

  abstract = {Purpose: Many researchers have studied the acoustics, physiology, and perceptual characteristics of the voice source, but despite significant attention, it remains unclear which aspects of the source should be quantified and how measurements should be made. In this study, the authors examined the relationships among a number of existing measures of the glottal source spectrum, along with the association of these measures to overall spectral shapes and to glottal pulse shapes, to determine which measures of the source best capture information about the shapes of glottal pulses and glottal source spectra. Method: Seventy-eight different measures of source spectral shapes were made on the voices of 70 speakers. Principal components analysis was applied to measurement data, and the resulting factors were compared with factors similarly derived from oral speech spectra and glottal pulses. Results: Results revealed high levels of duplication and overlap among existing measures of source spectral slope. Further, existing measures were not well aligned with patterns of spectral variability. In particular, existing spectral measures do not appear to model the higher frequency parts of the source spectrum adequately. Conclusion: The failure of existing measures to adequately quantify spectral variability may explain why results of studies examining the perceptual importance of spectral slope have not produced consistent results. Because variability in the speech signal is often perceptually salient, these results suggest that most existing measures of source spectral slope are unlikely to be good predictors of voice quality.},

  abstract = {Although the amount of inharmonic energy (noise) present in a human voice is an important determinant of vocal quality, little is known about the perceptual interaction between harmonic and inharmonic aspects of the voice source. This paper reports three experiments investigating this issue. Results indicate that perception of the harmonic slope and of noise levels are both influenced by complex interactions between the spectral shape and relative levels of harmonic and noise energy in the voice source. Just-noticeable differences (JNDs) for the noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR) varied significantly with the NHR and harmonic spectral slope, but NHR had no effect on JNDs for NHR when harmonic slopes were steepest, and harmonic slope had no effect when NHRs were highest. Perception of changes in the harmonic source slope depended on NHR and on the harmonic source slope: JNDs increased when spectra rolled off steeply, with this effect in turn depending on NHR. Finally, all effects were modulated by the shape of the noise spectrum. It thus appears that, beyond masking, understanding perception of individual parameters requires knowledge of the acoustic context in which they function, consistent with the view that voices are integral patterns that resist decomposition.},

This model includes parameters to characterize the harmonic and inharmonic voice sources, vocal tract transfer function, fundamental frequency, and amplitude of the voice, which together serve to completely quantify the integral sound of a target voice sample. In experiment 1, 200 voices with and without diagnosed vocal pathology were fit with the model using analysis-by-synthesis. The resulting synthetic voice samples were not distinguishable from the original voice tokens, suggesting that the model has all the parameters it needs to fully quantify voice quality. In experiment 2 parameters that model the harmonic voice source were removed one by one, and the voice tokens were re-synthesized with the reduced model. In every case the lower-dimensional models provided worse perceptual matches to the quality of the natural tokens than did the original set, indicating that the psychoacoustic model cannot be reduced in dimensionality without loss of fit to the data. Results confirm that this model can be validly applied to quantify voice quality in clinical and research applications.},

Since F0 is highly ambiguous and variable in the speech signal, effective pitch-range perception is important in perceiving the intended linguistic pitch targets. This study argues that the effectiveness of pitch-range perception can be achieved by taking advantage of other signal-internal information that co-varies with F0, such as voice quality cues. This study provides direct perceptual evidence that voice quality cues as an indicator of pitch ranges can effectively affect the pitch-height perception. A series of forced-choice pitch classification experiments with four spectral conditions were conducted to investigate the degree to which manipulating spectral slope affects pitch-height perception. Both non-speech and speech stimuli were investigated. The results suggest that the pitch classification function is significantly shifted under different spectral conditions. Listeners are likely to perceive a higher pitch when the spectrum has higher high-frequency energy (i.e., tenser phonation). The direction of the shift is consistent with the correlation between voice quality and pitch range. Moreover, cue integration is affected by the speech mode, where listeners are more sensitive to relative difference within an utterance when hearing speech stimuli. This study generally supports the hypothesis that voice quality is an important enhancement cue for pitch range.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Phonation is used in many tonal languages, but how it should be incorporated into tonal systems is not well understood. The purpose of this dissertation thus is to examine the role of phonation in tonal contrasts, and to investigate how phonation and pitch interact in the tonal space. This dissertation presents close studies of tonal contrasts from three language families that provide different answers to these questions. From the case of Yi languages, where the tense/lax phonation ("register") contrast is orthogonal to the tone contrast, we show that phonation production can be independent from tonal production. Phonation in these languages is not only phonologically contrastive, but phonetically completely independent. Tone is purely pitch, and phonation is purely voice quality. From the case of Mandarin, where non-modal phonation (specifically, creaky voice) is known to be an allophonic cue to the low-dipping Tone 3, we show that the presence of creak in Mandarin is purely driven by pitch range, and can occur with any of the low-pitch targets. Moreover, we show that in a corpus of pitch sweeps that rose or fell over large pitch ranges, Mandarin speakers' voice quality co-vary with pitch in a wedge-shaped function. Finally, we investigate the case of Black Miao, a language with five-level-tone contrasts, the case of maximum use of pitch contrast attested among languages. Due to limitations on pitch production and perception, it should be very hard to make these contrasts purely by pitch. Both production and perception experiments show that non-modal phonations provide very important cues in both tonal production and perception, but in different ways. On the one hand, the three mid-range tones (T22, T33, T44) have very similar pitch cues, but T33 is quite distinct from T22 and T44 by its breathy voice quality. On the other hand, the extra-high (T55) and extra-low (T11) tones show the same kind of pitch-dependent voice quality that was found in Mandarin: the extra-low pitches tend to be creaky while the extra-high pitches tend to be tense. Taking these cases together, we establish: 1) there are two different uses of phonation types, based on their relationship with pitch: pitch-dependent and pitch-independent, which can either enhance the perceptual distinctiveness of extreme pitch targets, or serve as a contrastive dimension for tones with similar pitch values; 2) tonal contrast is multidimensional, and the dimensionality of tonal contrasts in part depends on the size of the tonal inventory. We propose a new tone space model, and principles for good dispersion of tonal contrasts. This dissertation thus extends our knowledge about tonal contrasts, and provides a better understanding of the interaction between phonation and pitch in tone languages.},

This study investigates the tonal dispersion of a multiple-level tone system by exploring the cues used in producing and perceiving the five level tones of Black Miao. Both production and perception experiments show that non-modal phonations are very important cues for these tonal contrasts. Non-modal phonations significantly contribute to the dispersion of the five level tones in two ways: either by enhancing pitch contrasts or by providing an additional contrastive cue. Benefiting from more than one cue, the level tones T11, T33 and T55 are well distinguished in the tonal space; by contrast, the level tones T22 and T44, only contrasting in pitch, are the most confusable tones. The tonal registers model proposed in this article sheds light on the different uses of non-modal phonations across languages.},

The proposed technique is applied to the analysis of laryngealized phonation as this phonation type typically shows irregular vibration cycles. The reliability of this approach is validated with synthetic vocal fold vibration signals, demonstrating that it permits measuring the regularity of vocal fold vibration, unaffected by changes in fundamental frequency. The method is also applied to real electroglottographic signals recorded at the onset of vowel-initial nonsense words produced in a speeded repetition task by five female German speakers. Results show that the degree of laryngealization during the production of word-initial vowels is modulated by the presence of stress (with stressed vowels being less laryngealized). Due to its robustness to changes of F0, the proposed technique proves to be a suitable tool for studying vocal fold regularity in concatenated speech. Its applications are not limited to the study of glottalization, since the degree of regularity of vocal fold vibration has paralinguistic functions and is a clinically relevant measure of voice pathologies.},

  abstract = {The Formosan languages are the languages of the Aboriginal peoples of Taiwan. These languages are part of the Austronesian language family, and represent all but one primary branch of this family of 1,200+ languages. The Formosan languages are endangered, some critically so. While these languages have seen attention in the literature for their syntactic and phonological systems, little work has been done on their prosodic structure or intonation. This dissertation analyzes the prosodic structure and intonational phonology of Mantauran Rukai, Budai Rukai, Tsou, Kanakanavu, Hla’alua, Sandimen Paiwan, Piuma Paiwan, Kavalan, Amis, Bunun, Tgdaya Seediq, Truku Seediq, and Pazeh, based on original fieldwork. In addition, archival materials are incorporated into analyses of Tsou, Truku Seediq, Tgdaya Seediq, and Puyuma. This study finds that the Formosan languages show rich tonal phonologies in their intonational systems, and have complex interactions between stress assignment and morphology. Some examples include the following: Mantauran Rukai, previously described as an initial-stress language, actually has a complex stress assignment system with an alternation between first- and third-syllable stress, which as a system is unique in descriptions of stress assignment in the world’s languages. Hla’alua (Saaroa), previously described as having free variation between antepenultimate and penultimate stress, actually has an accent system in which some lexical items are consistently produced without an accented syllable, while others are. Hla’alua also has a rich tonal phonology assigned at two higher levels of the prosodic hierarchy. Kavalan has a unique rule that causes spreading tones to shift to the opposite domain edge when a certain number of tonal elements are aligned to the same boundary. Elements of the intonational phonology in Amis and Kavalan include glottal stops in addition to tonal elements. Bunun has distinct pitch accent melodies for words vs. clitics. In addition to the unique features found in individual Formosan languages, this dissertation’s comparative study finds at least two geographic areas within Taiwan in which features of prosody and intonation cluster. One is southwestern Taiwan, including Tsou, Kanakanavu, Hla’alua, and Rukai, which share features including a lack of glide-vowel contrasts and variability of initial H vs. L elements in certain prosodic domains. The other is eastern Taiwan, including Amis, Kavalan, and Puyuma, which share features including suppression of non-IP-final pitch accents, alternations between ultimate and pre-ultimate F0 peaks across intonational contours, and interactions between glottal stop epenthesis and intonational phonology.},

  abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis Cepstral peak prominence (CPP) has been reported as a reliable measure of dysphonia and a preferred alternative to harmonics‐to‐noise ratio (HNR). However, CPP has been observed to be sensitive to articulatory variation and vocal intensity. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of nasalance on CPP and HNR of voice signals. It was hypothesized that increased nasalance would be associated with decreased CPP. Study Design Within‐subject correlation design. Methods Thirty vocally healthy female participants were recorded reading and producing a vowel in alternation with a nasal consonant while wearing a nasometer for calculation of nasalance. Recorded vowel, nasalized, and nasal segments of speech were used to calculate CPP using Analysis of Dysphonia in Speech and Voice software, and HNR and vocal intensity using Praat software. Results Significant main effects of conditions were observed for CPP. CPP values decreased significantly when phonation changed from vowel to nasalized vowel and to nasal. There was correlation between CPP and nasalance and between CPP and intensity. HNR was slightly higher in the nasal condition than in vowel. There was a weak correlation between HNR and nasalance. No correlation was found between HNR and intensity. Conclusions CPP is sensitive to changes in vocal tract configuration caused by nasalization as well as intensity, whereas HNR is not. Therefore, CPP may reflect the periodicity in source signal or the filtering effects of vocal tract. Further research is needed to clarify the application and interpretation of CPP in clinical practice. Level of Evidence 4,  Laryngoscope, 129:E299–E304, 2019},

It can be regarded as a ‘missing link’ in tonogenesis: following the loss of voicing contrasts on syllableinitial consonants, Tamang has four tonal categories instead of its earlier two-tone system; the present state of the prosodic system is typologically transitional, in that these four tonal categories are realised by several cues which include fundamental frequency (F0), phonation type, and allophonic variation in the realisation of consonants. Acoustic and electroglottographic recordings of 131 words in two carrier sentences by 5 speakers were conducted (total number of target syllables analysed: n = 1,651). They allow for a description in terms of F0, glottal open quotient, duration, and realisation of consonants. The results confirm the diversity of cues to the four tonal categories, and show evidence of laxness on tones 3 and 4, i.e. on the two tones which originate diachronically in voiced initials. The discussion hinges on the phonological definition of tone.},

The least attractive of the options is the one currently most readily available in logistic regression software, the unstandardized coefficient divided by its standard error (which is actually the normal distribution version of the Wald statistic). One alternative has the advantage of simplicity, while a slightly more complex alternative most closely parallels the standardized coefficient in ordinary least squares regression, in the sense of being based on variance in the dependent variable and the predictors. The sixth alternative, based on information theory, may be the best from a conceptual standpoint, but unless and until appropriate algorithms are constructed to simplify its calculation, its use is limited to relatively simple logistic regression models in practical application.},

  abstract = {The Khoesan language Ju∣’hoansi has a rich set of phonation type contrasts: aspirated, glottalized, uvularized and epiglottalized consonants, as well as breathy, glottalized and epiglottalized vowels. These sounds form a natural class of gutturals, based on their participation in several phonotactic constraints. Gutturals are articulated in the laryngeal or pharyngeal region of the vocal tract, and are difficult to characterize as a unified group on the basis of a common articulator. This study reports on three experiments investigating the acoustic realization of gutturals. Results show that guttural vowels exhibit a range of marked (non-modal) acoustic voice quality attributes, and vowels following guttural consonants exhibit the same range of voice quality attributes through guttural co-articulation. Guttural co-articulation is sustained over a relatively long interval in Ju∣’hoansi. The timing of acoustic voice quality attributes associated with guttural consonants covers almost the same extent of the following vowels as the analogous acoustic attributes associated with diphthongs differing in voice quality (e.g., vowels that are breathy in the first mora and modally voiced on the second mora). Harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) captures the similarity of all gutturals, and spectral slope differentiates sounds involving glottal or pharyngeal stricture from those involving glottal opening.},

  abstract = {Purpose  Physiological and phonetic studies suggest that, at moderate levels of epilaryngeal stricture, the ventricular folds impinge upon the vocal folds and influence their dynamical behavior, which is thought to be responsible for constricted laryngeal sounds. In this work, the authors examine this hypothesis through biomechanical modeling. Method  The dynamical response of a low-dimensional, lumped-element model of the vocal folds under the influence of vocal–ventricular fold coupling was evaluated. The model was assessed for F0 and cover-mass phase difference. Case studies of simulations of different constricted phonation types and of glottal stop illustrate various additional aspects of model performance. Results  Simulated vocal–ventricular fold coupling lowers F0 and perturbs the mucosal wave. It also appears to reinforce irregular patterns of oscillation, and it can enhance laryngeal closure in glottal stop production. Conclusion  The effects of simulated vocal–ventricular fold coupling are consistent with sounds, such as creaky voice, harsh voice, and glottal stop, that have been observed to involve epilaryngeal stricture and apparent contact between the vocal folds and ventricular folds. This supports the view that vocal–ventricular fold coupling is important in the vibratory dynamics of such sounds and, furthermore, suggests that these sounds may intrinsically require epilaryngeal stricture.},

  abstract = {The present study provides an acoustic description of the vowel system of Santiago Mexquititlán Otomi (Hñäñho), an endangered and understudied Oto-Manguean language variety spoken in central Mexico. The goal of this production study was to determine whether the phonemic contrasts between Hñäñho vowels, as previously described impressionistically, are maintained in the acoustic realizations of a group of relatively balanced bilingual native speakers of Hñäñho or if Hñäñho phonemic categories are merging due to the extensive influence of Spanish. To this end, each Hñäñho speaker recorded a carefully designed list of 90 Hñäñho words and the resulting dataset of a total of 1507 tokens was subjected to analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to predict Bark scale correlates of vowel height (B1 – b0) and vowel frontness/backness (B2 – B1) and the Pillai scores were calculated in order to determine the degree of overlap for adjacent Hñäñho vowel pairs. The speakers’ Hñäñho vowels were also compared to their Spanish vowels. A list of five Spanish words was used and a total of 90 tokens of the Spanish vowels were recorded. The results confirm that the vowel system of Hñäñho, produced by older Hñäñho speakers, consists of 10 distinct phonemes. Hñäñho-specific phonetic details are discussed, including the fronted realization of the vowel /u/ as [u̟] and the lowering of the vowel /ɔ/ to [ɒ], which might lead to a future /a – ɔ/ merger. These findings underline the importance of early and sustained exposure to indigenous bilinguals’ native language for the maintenance of phonetic features of Hñäñho despite extensive contact with Spanish.},

I review some of the more persistent criticisms of P values and argue that most stem from misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations, rather than from intrinsic shortcomings of the P value. I show that P values are intimately linked to confidence intervals and to differences in Akaike's information criterion (ΔAIC), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of ΔAIC that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to ΔAIC. Since P values, confidence intervals, and ΔAIC are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

The language is diglossic, with the formal register used in written media and orally in formal settings. Colloquial Malayalam, for which there is no standard orthography, varies by region and social community (Asher \& Kumari 1997). The speech illustrated below is representative of the variety spoken by the Namboodiri subcaste of Brahmins in and around Kochi, a city in central Kerala. The Namboodiri subcaste was traditionally a land-owning priestly class, and until relatively recently, the community was very insular. Consequently, the dialect differed from standard Malayalam as it is spoken today; this is discussed in some detail in U. Namboodiripad (1989, personal communication).},

Source parameters, F0, EE, UP, RG, OQ and RD were obtained by manual inverse filtering and parameterization. Results for F sentences suggest that focalization depends on the balancing of focal and non-focal portions of the entire IP. Local prominence-enhancing shifts (towards tenser phonation) are complemented by deaccentuation of post-focal material. While the broad trends are similar in F and R contours, the rising F0 of the R sentences appears to counteract the deaccentuation pattern found with the F contours. Thus, focal accentuation yields less source differentiation in the later portions of the IP.},

As established by previous cross-linguistic studies of suppletion, most suppletion phenomena in Zapotec occur in the verb system. Nominal suppletion is attested in the possessed forms of selected nouns, such as tortilla, clothing, house, and pueblo, and the numeral system includes suppletive forms of the numeral first. Verbal suppletion types include suppletion based on aspect, mood, person/number of the subject, person of the oblique object, and valence. Each category of nominal and verbal suppletion is represented by a small number of strongly suppletive forms that appear to be etymologically distinct and a larger number of weakly suppletive forms that appear to derive from morphological processes that have ceased to be productive. By documenting suppletion phenomena across the Zapotec family, the present study aims to contribute both to the comparative Zapotec linguistics and to the empirical basis of the typological and theoretical investigation of suppletion.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is threefold: (i) to determine the number and acoustic-motor characteristics of the different phonation types, (ii) to develop auditorily-based speech processing methods suitable for the measurement of glottal parameters, (iii) to provide two equipollent pairs of glottal manner features that categorize the phonation types into the appropriate natural classes. Nine pitch-independent phonation types appear necessary to account for linguistically significant contrasts: (1) glottal stop, (2) whisper, (3) breath, (4) harsh voice, (5) harsh whispery voice, (6) breathy voice, (7) tense voice, (8) plain voice, (9) lax voice. The phonation types (1, 2, 3) form the category of glottal noise while (2, 3) constitute voicelessness. The phonation types (4, 5, 6) are categorized as noisy voice, the phonation types (7, 8, 9) as pure voice. The three glottal noise phonation types (1, 2, 3) are characterized by aperiodic waveforms and exhibit increasingly larger glottal openings from (1) glottal stop to (3) breath. Because acoustic damping grows with widening glottal aperture, the first formant bandwidth (B1) likewise broadens. The three noisy voice phonation types (4, 5, 6) are characterized by periodic waveforms and have either considerable modulation noise (harsh voice), aspiration noise (breathy voice), or both (harsh whispery voice). The three pure voice phonation types (7, 8, 9) are also characterized by periodic waveforms, but with no significant modulation or aspiration noise, tense voice being cued by a flat spectral tilt, plain voice by an intermediate spectral tilt, lax voice by a steep spectral tilt. The nine phonation types are classified both by (I) a three-by-three motor hierarchy and (II) a linear acoustic scale of derived glottal bandwidth (GBW) that progressively narrows from (1) glottal stop to (9) lax voice. The primary motor features of position consist of the antagonistic pair [voice, noise]. The secondary motor features of stricture consist of the antagonistic pair [constricted, spread]. To demonstrate the generality of the feature framework adopted for glottal manner, equipollent feature systems for vowel height, backness, and supraglottal manner (major class features) are also proposed.},

  abstract = {Isthmus Zapotec (autoglossonym: [dìʤàˈzàˑ]) is the common name used for a variety of Zapotec (Otomanguean family) spoken on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico (Suárez 1983: xvi; Campbell 1997: 158). It is now officially listed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI 2008) as ‘zapoteco de la planicie costera’ (‘coastal plain Zapotec’) to distinguish it from other varieties of Zapotec spoken on the Isthmus. It is the mother tongue of many inhabitants of various cities and towns, as well as many smaller communities (INALI 2008), with some lexical, syntactic and phonetic variation between towns only a few kilometers apart. The ISO 639-3 code for this variety is zai. Since the most recent census figures do not separate out the varieties of Zapotec, and have not done so reliably when attempted, official statistics as to the number of speakers of Isthmus Zapotec are not available. (The               Ethnologue               (Lewis 2009) cites the 1990 census as listing 85,000 speakers; that figure must have been an interpretation of other statistics in the census.) INALI (personal communication, September 2008) estimates the current number to be about 104,000. In the city of Tehuantepec, the language is no longer widely used. In certain other locations, including Juchitán de Zaragoza, Spanish is becoming the dominant or the only language spoken by many people born after about 1990, although Zapotec is dominant in many outlying towns, including San Blas Atempa. Mature speakers have remarked that young people who are not fluent do not use tones correctly. Isthmus Zapotec has had active writers, including poets and novelists, since the first half of the twentieth century, well before an orthography was officially established (               Alfabeto popular               1956), but reading and writing of the language are still not taught in schools in the region.},

  abstract = {This chapter examines how two linguistic features commonly associated with African American English enable speakers to take stances about race. The analysis is based on the use of (-t/d) deletion and falsetto in sociolinguistic interviews with residents of Washington, DC. While broad distributional analyses reveal that African American speakers produce both features more frequently than white speakers, the explanation for this pattern can only be found by attending to the interactional moments when speakers use these features the most. For example, an African American woman uses her highest rates of (-t/d) deletion when talking about gentrification, as opposed to other topics that she does not characterize in racial terms. Similarly, African American women generally produce their phonetically strongest instantiations of falsetto when negatively evaluating gentrification and racism. I conclude by underscoring the importance of viewing components of ethnolinguistic repertoires as resources for taking stances about race and racially charged issues.},

Phonetics: Transcription, Production, Acoustics, and Perception introduces readers to the fundamental concepts of the discipline, providing coverage of all four areas of phonetics. This comprehensive textbook also familiarizes readers with concepts from other disciplines related to phonetics--such as physiology, anatomy, and psychology--through relatable, real-life examples. Now in its second edition, the text has been substantially revised to improve clarity and currency, based on student feedback received by the authors over the past decade. Brief "Nutshell" introductions have been added to all chapters to provide a clear overview of key points within the body of the text. Expanded content to this new edition examines voice quality, the acoustic correlates of different phonation types, intonation, and different theories of speech perception. Written in a clear and concise style by two of the field's leading scholars, this textbook: Covers related relevant areas, including vocal fold vibration and the physiology of the ear. Offers examples from other languages to highlight aspects of phonetics not found in English. Includes chapter-by-chapter exercises, engaging illustrations, and a detailed glossary. Features a companion website containing additional resources such as figures and sound files. Is taught in nearly every linguistics department as a required course for undergraduates majoring in linguistics. It is also taught in speech sciences / speech pathology. There are books that cater specifically to this market but there's a fair number of instructors in Communication/Speech Science departments who use books written by linguists"--},

First, Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) reveal the non-linear pattern of some acoustic cues on the perception of prosodic features. Second, these same models reveal that while some of the untrained annotators are using these cues to determine prosodic features, the magnitude of effect differs quite dramatically across the annotators. Finally, the trained annotators follow the same cues as subsets of the untrained annotators, but present a much stronger effect for many of the cues. The findings show that while prosody perception is systemically related to acoustic and contextual cues, there are also individual differences that are limited to the selection and magnitude of the factors that influence prosodic rating, and the relative weighting among those factors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.},

  abstract = {Among phoneticians, the Vocal Profile Analysis (VPA) is one of the most widely used methods for the componential assessment of voice quality. Whether the ultimate goal of the VPA evaluation is the comparative description of languages or the characterization of an individual speaker, the VPA protocol shows great potential for different research areas of speech communication. However, its use is not without practical difficulties. Despite these, methodological studies aimed at explaining where, when and why issues arise during the perceptual assessment process are rare. In this paper we describe the methodological stages through which three analysts evaluated the voices of 99 Standard Southern British English male speakers, rated their voices using the VPA scheme, discussed inter-rater disagreements, and eventually produced an agreed version of VPA scores. These scores were then used to assess correlations between settings. We show that it is possible to reach a good degree of inter-rater agreement, provided that several calibration and training sessions are conducted. We further conclude that the perceptual assessment of voice quality using the VPA scheme is an essential tool in fields such as forensic phonetics but, foremost, that it can be adapted and modified to a range of research areas, and not necessarily limited to the evaluation of pathological voices in clinical settings.},

  abstract = {Yerevan Armenian is a variety of Eastern Armenian with a three-way voicing contrast that includes voiced, voiceless unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated stops, but previous work has not converged on a description of how voice quality is involved in the contrast. We demonstrate how voice quality can be assessed in a two-dimensional acoustic space using a spectral tilt measure in conjunction with a measure of spectral noise. Eight speakers produced a list of words with prevocalic word-initial and postvocalic word-final plosives. The results suggest that Yerevan Armenian has breathy-voiced plosives which are produced with closure voicing and a relatively spread glottis that is maintained into a following vowel. These qualitatively differ from some Indic ones in that they do not have an extended interval of voiced aspiration after the closure. For the voiceless unaspirated plosives, most speakers produced acoustically modal voiceless plosives, although two showed evidence for some glottal constriction and tensing. Many acoustic cues contribute to overall reliable discriminability of the three-way contrast in both initial and final position. Nevertheless, closure voicing intensity and aspiration duration together provide a robust separation of the three categories in both positions. We also find that back vowels are fronted after the breathy-voiced plosives, which supports a historical analysis in which early Armenian voiced stops were also breathy, rather than plain voiced.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel locality violation and its repair in Sierra Zapotec: an object pronoun cannot cliticize when the subject is a lexical DP. This locality effect differs from more familiar ones (e.g., superiority) because the lexical DP does not move. We argue that it is nonetheless able to Agree, consistent with the idea that locality conditions apply to Agree, rather than to a separate movement component. We develop an account in which pronouns and lexical DPs interact with the same probe because they share featural content. In particular, we suggest that the person domain extends to include non-pronominal DPs, so that all nominals are specified for a feature we call δ (to resonate with DP); all and only personal pronouns are specified for π. This account requires a departure from Chomsky’s (2000, 2001) classical system of featural co-variation (Agree). A functional head must be able to participate in overprobing, interacting with a goal even though its requirements would appear to be met. We introduce a probe activation model for Agree, in which, after applying once, the operation can but not need apply again. We also consider two other mechanisms recently proposed to derive overprobing — Deal’s (2015, 2020) “insatiable probes” and Coon \& Keine’s (to appear) “feature gluttony” —though neither is able to account for the locality pattern.},

This article addresses this gap through the presentation of a case study of Lachixío Zapotec speech registers indexed though falsetto, breathy, creaky, modal, and whispered voice qualities. I describe the system of contrastive speech registers in Lachixío Zapotec and then track a speaker on a single evening where she switches between three of these registers. Analyzing line-by-line conversational structure I show both obligatory and creative shifts between registers that co-occur with shifts in the participant structures of the situated social interactions. I then examine similar uses of voice qualities in other Zapotec languages and in the two unrelated language families Nahuatl and Mayan to suggest the possibility that such voice registers are a feature of the Mesoamerican culture area.

  abstract = {Linguistic sound systems necessarily possess contrastive values that are sufficiently distinct from one another that their individual characters may be learned by the listener. In this way, any given value in any given system fulfils its functional role of rendering forms distinct which differ in meaning. Articulatory, aerodynamic, acoustic and auditory constraints serve to mediate between such sound–meaning correspondences in non-trivial ways. Indeed, if it can be shown that the sound patterns of language are in part explainable by these physical systems, then students of linguistic sound systems would do well to study in detail the phonetic base. Consider an example case. Laryngeal gestures and supralaryngeal gestures are by and large articulatorily independent of each other. Thus, for example, a voiceless aspirated stop consists of an oral occlusion, cued by silence, as well as an articulatorily independent laryngeal abduction, cued by broadband noise. Were the phonetic realisation of these two gestures strictly simultaneous, the cues signalling the laryngeal abduction would not be perceived as such by the listener (*[ot]). A listener can tell that there is no voicing, but cannot recover more specific information regarding the state of the glottis during oral closure. Stated simply, the full closure here reduces the acoustic output to zero. With zero acoustic energy, no source information other than silence is transmitted to the listener. However, upon staggering the two gestures, the otherwise obscured information is rendered salient.},

  abstract = {Generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) are increasingly popular in dynamic speech analysis, where the focus is on measurements with temporal or spatial structure such as formant, pitch or tongue contours. GAMMs provide a range of tools for dealing with the non-linear contour shapes and complex hierarchical organisation characteristic of such data sets. This, however, means that analysts are faced with non-trivial choices, many of which have a serious impact on the statistical validity of their analyses. This paper presents type I and type II error simulations to help researchers make informed decisions about modelling strategies when using GAMMs to analyse phonetic data. The simulations are based on two real data sets containing F2 and pitch contours, and a simulated data set modelled after the F2 data. They reflect typical scenarios in dynamic speech analysis. The main emphasis is on (i) dealing with dependencies within contours and higher-level units using random structures and other tools, and (ii) strategies for significance testing using GAMMs. The paper concludes with a small set of recommendations for fitting GAMMs, and provides advice on diagnosing issues and tailoring GAMMs to specific data sets. It is also accompanied by a GitHub repository including a tutorial on running type I error simulations for existing data sets: https://github.com/soskuthy/gamm\_strategies.},

  abstract = {The Eighth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (Leeds, 1975) provided an opportunity, at a discussion seminar called specially for that purpose, ‘The larynx and language’, for phoneticians anxious to put phonation distinctions on a more systematic footing to appeal to specialists in the aerodynamic aspects of laryngal activity and in the physiology of the larynx to help them with criteria to define the phonation distinctions so far observed in languages. In introducing the topic at the discussion seminar E. J. A. Henderson confined her examples to Cambodian, to illustrate the ‘sepulchral’ phonation appropriate to what she terms the lower register (Henderson 1952: 157); but a number of languages are listed in Catford 1964 as making lexically distinctive use of phonation types, Danish, Hindi, Nilotic, Javanese, and Gujerati (p. 36); and Ladefoged 1971 lists some of these and a considerable number of others, including Sindhi, Zulu, Hausa, Wolof, and French (pp. 12–19). In part this article is a continuation of that attempt to attract the attention of instrumental phoneticians to problems posed by phonation differences in languages such as these; but to a large extent it results from a re-examination of various published accounts of phonation distinctions that I undertook in the course of teaching general phonetics. The most comprehensive of these accounts, and the one that I shall chiefly refer to, is Catford 1964, and the tape-recording in which he illustrates a number of the phonation types that he distinguishes in that article; but I have also drawn on Sweet 1877 (3rd edition, 1906), guided by Henderson 1971, Pike 1943, Heffner 1950, Abercrombie 1967, and Ladefoged 1971.},

  abstract = {Asian languages reveal a continuum from quasi-disyllables to highly eroded monosyllables. These variegated states are now understood to be different stages along a common evolutionary path. An overview is proposed, beginning with the earliest stages of monosyllabicization, before the generalization of a strictly monosyllabic phonological structure. The well-documented processes of consonantal depletion which lead to the development of phonation-type registers and tones are presented within a general model. Lastly, phonological evolutions observed at advanced stages of segmental depletion are discussed. The concluding note concerns the aftermath of segmental depletion: the recreation of polysyllables.},

  abstract = {Phonation type, a phonatory dimension ranging from hypofunctional/breathy to hyperfunctional/pressed, is important both from a clinical and acoustical point of view; hyperfunctional voice can lead to voice disorders and hypofunctional voice reduces text intelligibility. Five male singers sang diminuendo sequences of the syllable /pae/ and three of them also produced speech or singing samples with different phonation types which were rated for phonatory pressedness by a panel of voice experts. The sequences were analyzed by inverse filtering and the associated subglottal pressures were estimated as the oral pressures during the /p/ occlusion. The results showed strong quasi-linear correlations between the peak-to-peak amplitude of the flow glottogram (henceforth pulse amplitude) and mean subglottal pressure, mean airflow, and the level difference between the first and second voice source partials L1–L2. These correlations were found to vary systematically with phonation type. Regardless of phonation type, the correlation between the pulse amplitude and the amplitude of the voice source fundamental frequency was very close to 1.0. The level difference between the first and second spectrum partials L1–L2 in narrow-band long-term-average spectra of speech and singing was found to vary systematically with phonation type in a manner related to voice experts’ ratings of perceived degree of pressedness. The findings support the assumption that the combination of subglottal pressure and level of the voice source fundamental is useful for an objective measure of phonation type.},

  abstract = {Summary 		Our most widely-used model of tonogenesis is Haudricourt’s 1954 classic analysis of Vietnamese tonogenesis. This paper examines Vietnamese evidence and this dominant model of tonogenesis, arguing that the Haudricourt analysis should be updated, replacing its segmentally-driven model by a laryngeally-based model, incorporating the effects of voice-quality distinctions.             This proposed model provides phonetically-plausible paths of change, not just for Vietnamese, but also for the widely- attested correlations between initial voicing and pitch height and between voice quality and vowel quality. At the same time, these same laryngeal considerations provide a phonetic motivation for the preference for the development of breathy voice from voiced stop onsets over sonorants and fricatives. Of equal importance, the model appears to provide significant insights into tonogenesis in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas, that is, the applicability model is not restricted to any particular geographical area.             Zusammenfassung 		Eines der verbreitesten Modelle für den Ursprung und die Spaltung der Töne ist die klassische, von Haudricourt 1954 dargestellte Analyse der Tonogenese des Vietnamesischen. In diesem Aufsatz wird dieses eben genannte und in der Lehre der Tonursprung dominante Modell unter die Lupe genommen. Wir meinen, man sollte vielleicht die Haudricourt’sche Analyse etwas auffrischen, indem die segmentale Basis durch eine Fundierung ersetzt wird, die auf den Einfluss der Stimmen- Qualitaet (þvoice quality“) eingebaut ist.             Dieses neue Modell liefert phonetisch-plausible Möglichkeiten, nicht nur für das Vietnamesische, sondern auch für Sprachen in denen eine starke Korrelation zwischen der Stimmhaftigkeit der Anlauts-Konsonanten und der Höhe der Silbenfrequenz, sowie zwischen Stimmqualität und Vokal-Qualität vorliegt. Zur gleichen Zeit liefert die Einbeziehung des Stimmerzeugungsapparats eine phonetische Erklärung und Motivation dafür, dass Ver- schlusslaute den Vorteil über Frikativa und Sonorantlautung im Anlaut besitzen. Außerdem noch bringt es neues Licht in den Prozess der Tonogenese in Sprachen so divers wie diejenigen von Südost-Asien, Ost-Asien, Süd-Asien, Afrika, Europa, und Nord- und Südamerika, d.h. Sprachen in praktischen allen geographischen Gegenden der Welt.             Résumé 		Le modèle le plus communément accepté de tonogénèse est celui développé par Haudricourt dans son analyse classique du développement des tons en vietnamien en 1954. Le présent article ré-examine le modèle posé pour la tonogénèse en vietnamien et propose une révision du modèle d’Haudricourt, remplaçant une approche basée sur les segments par une approche basée sur les phénomènes laryngaux, en particulier sur les effets de différences de qualité de voix.             Le modèle que nous proposons décrit des séquences de changements phonétiquement plausibles, non seulement pour le vietnamien mais aussi pour les corrélations fréquemment attestées d’une part entre voisement initial et hauteur tonale, d’autre part entre qualité de voix et timbre vocalique. Les phénomènes laryngaux que nous décrivons expliquent aussi la prépondérance du développement de la voix soufflée à partir d’occlusives voisées plutôt qu’à partir de sonantes et fricatives. Ce modèle n’est pas restreint à une aire géographique particulière, mais éclaire la tonogénèse dans d’autres langues d’Asie du Sud-est, d’Asie, d’Afrique, d’Europe et des Amériques.},

  abstract = {San Jerónimo Acazulco Otomi (SJAO) is an underdescribed and endangered Oto-Manguean language spoken in central Mexico. This paper provides an analysis of the phonology of tonal contrasts in SJAO and the phonetics of their realization based on pitch pattern data derived from audio recordings of citation forms of SJAO words. Each SJAO lexical word has one and only one tonal sequence – either /H/ or /HL/. This sequence is underlyingly associated with one syllable in the word. Other syllables are not specified for tone, and their phonetic realization is predictable depending on their position relative to the tonal syllable. A phonetic analysis revealed that underlyingly-tonal syllables are phonetically distinct from non-tonal syllables: those with /H/ are produced with greater vocal effort (measured by spectral tilt), and those with /HL/ are longer, louder, and bear a higher f0 (fundamental frequency), compared with non-tonal syllables. This analysis differs from previous accounts of lexical prosody in other Otomi varieties, which have either described a three-way system of high, low, and rising tones contrasting on every stem syllable, or a system where one syllable per word is assigned a stress-like ‘accent’. This difference from previous analyses suggests that there is a third possible characterization of lexical prosody for Otomi, which is appropriate for SJAO and potentially other understudied varieties.},

Examinaré los criterios generales y particulares de cada lengua para distinguir secuencias y unidades en estas lenguas. Mostraré que en ambos casos los criterios no siempre coinciden: ciertas secuencias resultan ser secuencias según algunos criterios pero como unidades según otros. Basándome en estas observaciones e inspirado en la Tipología Canónica (Brown et al. 2012), argumentaré que la distinción entre las secuencias y unidades no es dicotómica, sino multidimensional: los casos individuales pueden considerarse simultáneamente secuencias en algunos aspectos, pero unidades en otros, entonces la tipología de los comportamientos es más rica que la oposición binaria simple.},

First, stem alternation as the exponent of the                     agent is cross-linguistically rare (although it is common within the Otomanguean languages). Furthermore, the category of                     agentivity has not been studied in detail in Zapotecan languages, but this paper shows the pervasiveness of agentivity in the                     Teotitlán Zapotec grammar.},

Respiratory/laryngeal coupling at response onset varied from glottal stop to aspirate. Complexity varied from isolated vowel to short sentence. The range from shortest to longest average LRT value across all tasks was 69 ms. Significant differences among tasks indicate that acoustic LRT values are sensitive to relatively small magnitude effects associated with respiratory/laryngeal coupling and task complexity. Results led to formulation of two hypotheses, which, while consistent with present findings, require further investigation: First, LRT increases directly with increasing glottal resistance. Second, LRT increases directly with increases in the number of stressed syllables in the response.},

The goal is to determine whether this Khmer dialect still preserves this historical contrast. Out of seven acoustic parameters measured, four, namely *H1−*H2, *H1−A1, *H1−*A3, and vowel RMS amplitude successfully distinguished between breathy and clear vowels, with *H1−*H2 measured at the beginning of the vowel being the most robust cue. However, the use of these cues varied from speaker to speaker. The *H1−*H2 measurement obtained from male speakers’ production suggested that the contrast being realized may be that of a tense versus lax voice rather than a breathy versus clear voice. It is concluded that the historical breathy and clear phonation distinction in Khmer is preserved among female speakers, but this distinction may be disappearing or have become a tense versus lax distinction among male speakers.},

  abstract = {In phonetics, many datasets are encountered which deal with dynamic data collected over time. Examples include diphthongal formant trajectories and articulator trajectories observed using electromagnetic articulography. Traditional approaches for analyzing this type of data generally aggregate data over a certain timespan, or only include measurements at a fixed time point (e.g., formant measurements at the midpoint of a vowel). This paper discusses generalized additive modeling, a non-linear regression method which does not require aggregation or the pre-selection of a fixed time point. Instead, the method is able to identify general patterns over dynamically varying data, while simultaneously accounting for subject and item-related variability. An advantage of this approach is that patterns may be discovered which are hidden when data is aggregated or when a single time point is selected. A corresponding disadvantage is that these analyses are generally more time consuming and complex. This tutorial aims to overcome this disadvantage by providing a hands-on introduction to generalized additive modeling using articulatory trajectories from L1 and L2 speakers of English within the freely available R environment. All data and R code is made available to reproduce the analysis presented in this paper.},

This tutorial introduces readers to mixed models, Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). These approaches are ideal for analyzing nonlinear change over time where there are nested dependencies, such as time points within dyad (in repeated interaction experiments) or time points within chain (in iterated learning experiments). In addition, the tutorial gives recommendations for choices about model fitting. Annotated scripts in the online Supplementary Data provide the reader with R code to serve as a springboard for the reader’s own analyses.},

  abstract = {The relationship between prosody and perceived affect involves multiple variables. This paper explores the interplay of three: voice quality, f0 contour, and the hearer's language background. Perception tests were conducted with speakers of Irish English, Russian, Spanish, and Japanese using three types of synthetic stimuli: (1) stimuli varied in voice quality, (2) stimuli of uniform (modal) voice quality incorporating affect-related f0 contours, and (3) stimuli combining specific non-modal voice qualities with the affect-related f0 contours of (2). The participants rated the stimuli for the presence/strength of affective colouring on six bipolar scales, e.g., happy-sad. The results suggest that stimuli incorporating non-modal voice qualities, with or without f0 variation, are generally more effective in affect cueing than stimuli varying only in f0. Along with similarities in the affective responses across these languages, many points of divergence were found, both in terms of the range and strength of affective responses overall and in terms of specific stimulus-to-affect associations. The f0 contour may play a more important role, and tense voice a lesser role in affect signalling in Japanese and Spanish than in Irish English and Russian. The greatest cross-language differences emerged for the affects intimate, formal, stressed, and relaxed.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to better understand the cause-effect relation between vocal fold physiology and the resulting vibration pattern and voice acoustics. Using a three-dimensional continuum model of phonation, the effects of changes in vocal fold stiffness, medial surface thickness in the vertical direction, resting glottal opening, and subglottal pressure on vocal fold vibration and different acoustic measures are investigated. The results show that the medial surface thickness has dominant effects on the vertical phase difference between the upper and lower margins of the medial surface, closed quotient, H1-H2, and higher-order harmonics excitation. The main effects of vocal fold approximation or decreasing resting glottal opening are to lower the phonation threshold pressure, reduce noise production, and increase the fundamental frequency. Increasing subglottal pressure is primarily responsible for vocal intensity increase but also leads to significant increase in noise production and an increased fundamental frequency. Increasing AP stiffness significantly increases the fundamental frequency and slightly reduces noise production. The interaction among vocal fold thickness, stiffness, approximation, and subglottal pressure in the control of F0, vocal intensity, and voice quality is discussed.},

  abstract = {As the primary means of communication, voice plays an important role in daily life. Voice also conveys personal information such as social status, personal traits, and the emotional state of the speaker. Mechanically, voice production involves complex fluid-structure interaction within the glottis and its control by laryngeal muscle activation. An important goal of voice research is to establish a causal theory linking voice physiology and biomechanics to how speakers use and control voice to communicate meaning and personal information. Establishing such a causal theory has important implications for clinical voice management, voice training, and many speech technology applications. This paper provides a review of voice physiology and biomechanics, the physics of vocal fold vibration and sound production, and laryngeal muscular control of the fundamental frequency of voice, vocal intensity, and voice quality. Current efforts to develop mechanical and computational models of voice production are also critically reviewed. Finally, issues and future challenges in developing a causal theory of voice production and perception are discussed.},

This paper hence argues for the importance of (abstract) underlying representations that allow purely phonological accounts of apparent lexical idiosyncrasies. In addition, it adds to the growing body of evidence for sub-tonal features.},
